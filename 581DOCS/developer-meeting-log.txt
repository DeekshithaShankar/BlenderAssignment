Sun, Sep 22, 2024, 23:49:48 - Jeroen Bakker: Iliya Katushenock: I can add it to my list of cleanups :-) but any help appreciated
Sun, Sep 22, 2024, 23:53:43 - iss: What is the workflow when I want to update tests (in tests repo) in PR with functional changes? If this is even possible.
I would assume, that would have to push to branch in test repo, reference commit in blender branch, similar to release branch workflow, but I would rather ask than experiment.
Mon, Sep 23, 2024, 00:11:42 - Jeroen Bakker: iss:  does https://developer.blender.org/docs/handbook/testing/setup/#committing-test-data describe your case?
Mon, Sep 23, 2024, 00:14:46 - iss: Jeroen Bakker: Not really, this is for main branch. I have PR where I am changing how feature behaves and want green checkmarks when I run buildbot. Normally I would wait until PR is merged and commit new tests separately, but I was wondering whether this can be done in 1 step
Mon, Sep 23, 2024, 00:19:55 - Jeroen Bakker: A bit tricky as the hash you're referring to isn't stored on the same repository, (main vs your clone). It should be possible to alter the `.gitmodules` in your development branch, but revert it before you merge into main... NOTE that I haven't tried this.
Mon, Sep 23, 2024, 00:21:40 - iss: Sounds to me like "So technically possible, but probably not how we should do things"
Mon, Sep 23, 2024, 00:23:43 - Aras Pranckeviƒçius: iss: wouldn't it work if your code branch is in your code fork (as usual), but then you create a branch for your test changes _in the main repo_ (i.e. not in your fork)?
Mon, Sep 23, 2024, 00:23:44 - Alaska: What seems to have been done in the past is this:

1. A new branch is created in `blender/blender-test-data` with your files.
2. In your branch of Blender point to the relevant commit in the test data repo/branch and open a PR.
3. Then when you're ready to commit to main. You do something... I believe you merge your branch in `blender/blender-test-data` to main, point to the new commit in your Blender branch, then commit your changes to the Blender repo?
Mon, Sep 23, 2024, 00:25:03 - Alaska: I'm primarily looking at this example:
https://projects.blender.org/blender/blender/pulls/126882
https://projects.blender.org/blender/blender-test-data/src/branch/metallic-light-tree
Mon, Sep 23, 2024, 00:33:00 - iss: Alaska: That example sounds to me like tests have been added to tests repo (not forked), but PR was only for submodule commit change. 
Does not sound useful to me. I just wanted to clarify how this should be done, because I never did change tested behavior before. 
Mon, Sep 23, 2024, 00:34:29 - Alaska: I might of got a bit confused. I'll leave it to someone else to suggest there workflow.
Mon, Sep 23, 2024, 02:56:29 - Julian Eisel: LazyDodo: hey, can you quickly verify this? [Fix: Correct Visual Studio ClangFormat custom path step](https://projects.blender.org/blender/blender-developer-docs/pulls/76)

The old single-threaded OBJ import functionality, is it a Python script? I need to test whether multi-threading should be used for processing geometric data or for handling folders, to compare which approach is faster for importing multiple files.
Mon, Sep 23, 2024, 06:26:09 - Hans Goudey: The new C++ importer will be faster either way since it has much less overhead

Mon, Sep 23, 2024, 06:33:40 - Wu Yiming: All my nodes cpp file still squiggles in vscode intellisense. Anybody having/had this kind of thing? (so far most other files I've been editing has been fine now with cmake compile command export)
Mon, Sep 23, 2024, 06:34:22 - Wu Yiming: In `node_composite_defocus.cc` the first squiggle comes at `MEM_cnew<NodeDefocus>(__func__);`
Mon, Sep 23, 2024, 06:34:41 - Wu Yiming: afterwards it's `IFACE` `ICON_NONE` etc
Mon, Sep 23, 2024, 06:38:31 - LazyDodo: no idea, maybe one of these tips will help?

Mon, Sep 23, 2024, 06:38:46 - LazyDodo: they mention a problems window, that be probably worth a look
Mon, Sep 23, 2024, 06:39:29 - sensarice: I'm using VScode for macOS, and the compiler is clang. I haven't encountered any issues so far, except for one line in the CMake file that has a yellow squiggly line.
Mon, Sep 23, 2024, 06:39:42 - Wu Yiming: that window basically is a duplicate of where the squiggles are üòÖ
Mon, Sep 23, 2024, 06:40:38 - Wu Yiming: increasing cache size, adding include paths manually etc none works :(

Mon, Sep 23, 2024, 06:44:35 - LazyDodo: does the squiggle for mem_cnew go away if you manually `#include "MEM_guardedalloc.h"` in that file?
Mon, Sep 23, 2024, 06:44:51 - Aras Pranckeviƒçius: Yes that was single threaded

Mon, Sep 23, 2024, 08:08:59 - dr.Sybren: Sure, but landing such a PR without even testing it in the buildbot is kinda meh. At least if it is indeed that PR that broke things. But I don't see any `@buildbot build` requests in there either.
Mon, Sep 23, 2024, 08:09:21 - LazyDodo: really wish i could kick the bots with a random hash
Mon, Sep 23, 2024, 08:10:22 - LazyDodo: i don't have the time / resources to bisect this locally, but would happly kick the bots into gear on commits i suspect
Mon, Sep 23, 2024, 08:11:34 - dr.Sybren: I'm just cross that someone lands a PR that wasn't tested by the buildbots, and then is not available to actually correct the thing when it turns out it goes wrong.
Mon, Sep 23, 2024, 08:14:22 - LazyDodo: that's cause you already decided that was the one , could be someone else
Mon, Sep 23, 2024, 08:14:47 - LazyDodo: put down the pitchfork üôÇ

Mon, Sep 23, 2024, 08:26:42 - Jacques Lucke: dr.sybren sorry for that, I honestly thought that I ran the patch through the buildbot a couple of times in the past (not after my last small cleanup though which I should have too).

Assets I will leave to Julian (IIRC he had some refactor ideas for it).

Tue, Sep 24, 2024, 03:02:53 - Falk David: There is a point about `Compile Commands` which you probably want
Tue, Sep 24, 2024, 04:32:37 - Wu Yiming: the compile commands thing still doesn't solve the red lines in my node files
Tue, Sep 24, 2024, 04:33:02 - Wu Yiming: manually include headers doesn't work either... Thankfully I am not currently working on those modules...
Tue, Sep 24, 2024, 05:51:01 - Fiona Cohen: Julian Eisel dr.sybren do you have a working document / dev talk thread for the remote asset library, when it comes to planning?
Tue, Sep 24, 2024, 05:51:52 - dr.Sybren: <@foxglove:blender.org "Julian Eisel dr.sybren do you ha..."> I haven't had a chance at all too look into the project. Agreed with Dalai to look at things together when he's back. I'm still elbows deep in the slotted Actions.
Tue, Sep 24, 2024, 05:53:22 - Fiona Cohen: Ok that makes sense - I had noted to check on that today for some reason... when Dalai is back will be better
Tue, Sep 24, 2024, 05:54:22 - dr.Sybren: üëçÔ∏è
Tue, Sep 24, 2024, 05:59:34 - Julian Eisel: Same here. AFAIK Pablo, Francesco and Dalai had a small workshop about the project, but neither of us was involved much 
Tue, Sep 24, 2024, 06:01:34 - Julian Eisel: There's this https://code.blender.org/2024/08/online-assets-workshop/

Tue, Sep 24, 2024, 06:36:52 - Sergey: Although, I THINK it should just work. 
Tue, Sep 24, 2024, 06:37:36 - Sergey: (i missed some piece of code in the build pipeline, which actually simplifies everyone's live :) )
Tue, Sep 24, 2024, 08:26:34 - binhnt1 joined the room
Tue, Sep 24, 2024, 08:27:19 - binhnt1: hi all, I want to modify some UI in blender, I tried to research on code, have any one can show me how Blender build it own UI please ?

Tue, Sep 24, 2024, 08:34:40 - Falk David: It's all fully custom, there is no simple answer to this question.
Tue, Sep 24, 2024, 08:35:45 - Falk David: You could dig around in `source/blender/editors/interface/`. I believe that's where a good chunk of the UI code lives.
Tue, Sep 24, 2024, 08:43:36 - binhnt1: hmmm, I would like to start research on UI to make some customized my UI, can you give me some idea where to start with ? ( can you show me the source code that starting to build the left panel for example ?
Tue, Sep 24, 2024, 08:45:09 - Falk David: Sorry, I think you will have to do this yourself.
Tue, Sep 24, 2024, 08:50:03 - binhnt1: thank you so much, I see the source code is very long and hard to trace out 
Tue, Sep 24, 2024, 08:50:44 - shamsi joined the room
Tue, Sep 24, 2024, 08:56:10 - shamsi: Hello everyone. I am a fan of all the work that is done on blender and for my gap year I would love to contribute to this project. I am quite experienced with python but I'll have to brush up on C++ before I feel confident in it again. My question is, is the best way to contribute to the project using these next 2 weeks to brush up on C++ and going through the bug list? 
Tue, Sep 24, 2024, 08:57:20 - LazyDodo: The developer handbook is your best source of information there, you can find it over at https://developer.blender.org/docs/handbook/new_developers/
Tue, Sep 24, 2024, 08:59:30 - shamsi: I have blender set up and I thought I move onto the "Get in contact" step, or is that more for support after starting to develop? Rather than for asking for direction before starting? Thanks in advance.
Tue, Sep 24, 2024, 09:01:57 - LazyDodo: probably best  to read the whole section, then decide where you want to go/what you want to work on, then ask specific questions if you have them
Tue, Sep 24, 2024, 09:04:16 - shamsi: That sounds great to me. I'll go ahead and go that. Thank you for the help LazyDodo

Tue, Sep 24, 2024, 10:10:14 - Aras Pranckeviƒçius: What is strange about it?
Tue, Sep 24, 2024, 10:22:50 - Jesse Y: Looks like the Mac builders might be having some issues since about 2 hours ago?
Tue, Sep 24, 2024, 10:27:34 - LazyDodo: Jesse Y: i see a small backlog, but they seem to be chewing through it?
Tue, Sep 24, 2024, 10:28:50 - Jesse Y: Looks like they started chewing at about the same time I sent my message :)  
Tue, Sep 24, 2024, 10:29:07 - LazyDodo: nah they have been chewing for a few hours, will likely take a bit longer
Tue, Sep 24, 2024, 10:29:52 - LazyDodo: there about 12 builds in the patch queue starting ~ 2 hours ago
Tue, Sep 24, 2024, 10:30:08 - LazyDodo: 4 still running
Tue, Sep 24, 2024, 15:49:44 - LazyDodo: Aras Pranckeviƒçius: you may have some success emulating that Xeon using https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/articles/tool/software-development-emulator.html there have been some instances it didn't catch a problem but usually it does an excellent job 
Tue, Sep 24, 2024, 15:51:04 - LazyDodo: never mind, just saw [that ticket](https://projects.blender.org/blender/blender/issues/125446) is months old and already fixed, still sde is a pretty neat tool to have in your toolbox
Tue, Sep 24, 2024, 20:50:55 - Aras Pranckeviƒçius: LazyDodo: well they just reopened the ticket, so apparently something is still wrong somewhere, just less consistently wrong and more randomly wrong. Thanks for the link, sounds like a useful tool indeed! (last time I learned "how to get a machine in the cloud", so that also was a useful experience :))
Tue, Sep 24, 2024, 20:58:23 - LazyDodo: the only time it really let me down was with that bitcount instruction thing a while ago, where it just matched the host rather than the cpu you told it to be
Tue, Sep 24, 2024, 21:54:33 - binhnt1: what is graphic library that Blender used for render ? I can see It s SDL3 , is it right ?
Tue, Sep 24, 2024, 22:18:28 - sensarice: I didn't understand the part of the code for OBJ import. How do they allocate threads?
Tue, Sep 24, 2024, 22:26:35 - Aras Pranckeviƒçius: You‚Äôll have to be more specific. Which part?

Nothing within OBJ import code ‚Äúallocates‚Äù threads. It just uses the regular ‚Äúparallel for‚Äù utilities from the rest of blender codebase, which in turn are implemented using Intel TBB libraries
Tue, Sep 24, 2024, 22:27:15 - Aras Pranckeviƒçius: It is OpenGL, Vulkan or Metal depending on platform and preferences 
Tue, Sep 24, 2024, 22:31:26 - sensarice: Before reading the code for the OBJ import, I had seen posts on other social media saying that Blender's OBJ import has become faster due to parallel reading. I believe that parallel reading requires some tools for thread allocation.
Tue, Sep 24, 2024, 22:36:41 - Aras Pranckeviƒçius: Blender OBJ importer has became faster (about two years ago) due to many things, but none of them were parallel processing https://aras-p.info/blog/2022/05/12/speeding-up-blender-obj-import/
Tue, Sep 24, 2024, 22:37:26 - Aras Pranckeviƒçius: What is the *actual* thing you are trying to figure out? Is some part of the code unclear? (In which case, what part?) Or is it something else?
Tue, Sep 24, 2024, 22:42:24 - sensarice: I wanted to learn how to perform parallel import of mesh models at the vertex. 
Tue, Sep 24, 2024, 22:51:03 - Aras Pranckeviƒçius: For OBJ format in particular? (it is not trivial to do that for OBJ)
Tue, Sep 24, 2024, 23:41:43 - Jesse Y: Hmm, did selection break in main?
Tue, Sep 24, 2024, 23:48:47 - Thomas Dinges: Do you have Vulkan enabled by chance? https://projects.blender.org/blender/blender/issues/127768
Tue, Sep 24, 2024, 23:50:00 - Jesse Y: Sadly I do not, still opengl here
Tue, Sep 24, 2024, 23:51:01 - Jesse Y: It's like "tweak" is permanently enabled
Tue, Sep 24, 2024, 23:57:28 - SteffenD: Same here. Linux / OpenGL no more select. Box select e.g. doesn't even start when using "B".
Tue, Sep 24, 2024, 23:58:25 - Jesse Y: Ok, I'll file an issue
Tue, Sep 24, 2024, 23:59:07 - SteffenD: --factory-startup also doesn't bring selection back
Wed, Sep 25, 2024, 00:00:51 - Jesse Y: https://projects.blender.org/blender/blender/issues/128104
Wed, Sep 25, 2024, 00:06:34 - Wu Yiming: B is ok in edit mode tho
Wed, Sep 25, 2024, 00:08:28 - sensarice: My original plan was to use a thread dispatcher to achieve parallel import of multiple folders. If we were to go deeper, it would involve parallel import of multiple objects. The idea of parallel vertex import came up temporarily, but after learning that OBJ files do not have vertex indices, I believe there is no need to parallelize the import of vertices.
Wed, Sep 25, 2024, 00:36:52 - Aras Pranckeviƒçius: Parallel import of separate files is *a lot* easier than parallel import of vertices inside OBJ file format, yes
Wed, Sep 25, 2024, 01:26:34 - Lukas T√∂nne: what does "drag select" here mean? i don't know how to repro
https://projects.blender.org/blender/blender/issues/128104
Wed, Sep 25, 2024, 01:29:05 - Lukas T√∂nne: does that only work with left-mouse-select?
Wed, Sep 25, 2024, 01:39:30 - Thomas Dinges: Lukas T√∂nne: Just left click and draw a border around objects, this works earlier now it immediately transforms the cube. Or press B to border select, nothing happens
Wed, Sep 25, 2024, 01:59:23 - Lukas T√∂nne: thanks for reporting, should be fixed now
Wed, Sep 25, 2024, 02:03:12 - Thomas Dinges: Lukas T√∂nne: Thank you, can confirm it's fixed. :) 
Wed, Sep 25, 2024, 02:26:55 - Aras Pranckeviƒçius: Lukas T√∂nne: behavior is fixed, but the format linter is now failing :/
Wed, Sep 25, 2024, 02:30:51 - Lukas T√∂nne: ffs ... stupid autoformat broke again
Wed, Sep 25, 2024, 02:32:40 - Lukas T√∂nne: formatting fixed

Reminder everyone to please keep the notes up-to-date, even just a mention, no need to wait for an entry in the manual. Otherwise features might get lost along the way :/ 

In 1 week is 4.3 Beta and the release notes should be locked as much as possible 
Wed, Sep 25, 2024, 03:00:00 - Thomas Dinges: ideasman42: ^^
Wed, Sep 25, 2024, 03:04:10 - Pablo Vazquez: Thomas Dinges I don't think there are any updates regarding Extensions for 4.3, we could remove this section https://developer.blender.org/docs/release_notes/4.3/extensions/ 
Wed, Sep 25, 2024, 03:04:36 - Thomas Dinges: I can only emphasize that, release notes (even if it's just a small mention), have to be added along the commit. An hour later is fine. A day later is already not imho. Otherwise as Pablo said, things are easily forgotten. 
Wed, Sep 25, 2024, 03:05:07 - Thomas Dinges: Pablo Vazquez: Would wait another week until Beta, but then can indeed remove empty areas
Wed, Sep 25, 2024, 03:06:44 - Pablo Vazquez: Thanks Thomas Dinges ! Related to this, the two Cycles changes in compatibility do not have a link to the commit, or "read more" for context https://developer.blender.org/docs/release\_notes/4.3/#cycles 
Wed, Sep 25, 2024, 03:13:04 - Alaska: Pablo Vazquez I know which commits they are. Would you like me to just add the commit hash beside it, hyperlinked to the relevant commit? 
Wed, Sep 25, 2024, 03:19:37 - Thomas Dinges: Alaska: That would help, yeah. Thank you
Wed, Sep 25, 2024, 03:25:07 - Alaska: Done: https://projects.blender.org/blender/blender-developer-docs/commit/567766a3a387b9669f828e2b2ea0e692b5a1c841
Wed, Sep 25, 2024, 03:48:06 - Pablo Vazquez: Thomas Dinges what do you think for the next release to not make empty pages. During the first month or two users end up clicking through mostly empty pages. 

Instead, when a new page is needed devs can copy over from the previous release.

Or do you think this may lead in even less updating of the notes? 
Wed, Sep 25, 2024, 03:51:22 - Thomas Dinges: What we can do is add all empty pages, but have the links on the overview page commented out until something is added.
Wed, Sep 25, 2024, 03:51:35 - Thomas Dinges: This way it's minimal work for devs, and users only see relevant content

Wed, Sep 25, 2024, 07:23:04 - Pablo Vazquez: Thomas Dinges good idea, let's do that. Once in beta we can remove the empty md files
Wed, Sep 25, 2024, 07:57:42 - Pablo Vazquez: Gitea question: Any repository setting I need to turn on to be able to assign reviewers to a PR? 
Wed, Sep 25, 2024, 07:57:46 - Pablo Vazquez: image.jpeg (Media omitted)
Wed, Sep 25, 2024, 07:58:28 - Pablo Vazquez: This is in the "Infrastructure" organization, I can set reviewers just fine in Blender's repo. 

I _think_ I have enough rights, I can make and delete repos
Wed, Sep 25, 2024, 07:59:24 - Thomas Dinges: Afaik it's not about your permissions, but the reviewers permission. They need to have certain ones. 
Wed, Sep 25, 2024, 07:59:42 - Thomas Dinges: For blender/blender people need to be in a team, at least collaborators afaik
Wed, Sep 25, 2024, 08:00:00 - Pablo Vazquez: the PR I'm trying to assign: https://projects.blender.org/infrastructure/web-assets/pulls/94704 
Wed, Sep 25, 2024, 08:00:38 - Pablo Vazquez: Oh, infrastucture only has Owners and Maintainers
Wed, Sep 25, 2024, 08:01:11 - Pablo Vazquez: I'm a maintainer, which seems to have enough rights
Wed, Sep 25, 2024, 08:01:49 - Thomas Dinges: I think you have to create a new team then. When you click on add you can assign various rights for that team then

Wed, Sep 25, 2024, 09:49:44 - iss: Does anybody know where VS code looks for build related definitions like `WITH_AUDASPACE` ? I have these enabled, but the code is grayed out and IDE features don't work on such code.
Wed, Sep 25, 2024, 09:55:51 - Sebastian Parborg: IIRC, it should look at your cmake settings. Do you also build it in vscode? Perhaps vscode is pointed to an other build directory where it is off?
Wed, Sep 25, 2024, 09:59:01 - LazyDodo: seems like it's an endless parade of vscode intellisense issues lately, has anyone ever played with trying clangd see if it's any better than the standard out of the box intellisense ? 
Wed, Sep 25, 2024, 10:05:22 - Sebastian Parborg: clangd is working fine for me with neovim. So I would expect that it work at least ok for VScode as well.
Might need to manually enable `CMAKE_EXPORT_COMPILE_COMMANDS` though.
Wed, Sep 25, 2024, 10:05:38 - LazyDodo: you need that for regular vs code as well, so no change there
Wed, Sep 25, 2024, 10:57:24 - iss: <@zeddb:blender.org "IIRC, it should look at your cma..."> But what is the cmake settings? CMakeCache.txt? 
Wed, Sep 25, 2024, 11:00:16 - iss: `CMAKE_EXPORT_COMPILE_COMMANDS` was off for me, did enable it, will see.
Wed, Sep 25, 2024, 11:02:19 - iss: At this point though, I feel like I am doing too many (>3) manual changes in that file. Do you have some way of making this globally? Like say I will wipe the build dir and want to quickly reset to my defaults
Wed, Sep 25, 2024, 11:03:10 - iss: I was thinking quite a bit about making "lite build", but for VSE, so that would be useful for that as well
Wed, Sep 25, 2024, 11:03:12 - LazyDodo: you could chuck them all into a cmake file and pass it to cmake? 
Wed, Sep 25, 2024, 11:03:39 - LazyDodo: kinda like `build_files\cmake\config\blender_full.cmake` 
Wed, Sep 25, 2024, 11:03:55 - LazyDodo: just save it to your homedir somewhere and pass it to cmake with -C 
Wed, Sep 25, 2024, 11:05:35 - iss: Aah so this is what MSVC was doing for me I guess...
Wed, Sep 25, 2024, 11:13:16 - Jesse Y: MSVC proper doesn't need the compile commands. It uses a different generator to generate real solution and project files so it gets its information that way. VSCode is the one that needs these magical settings.
Wed, Sep 25, 2024, 11:43:28 - iss: Right and MSVC was quite weird in that it had this configuration editor, that did not work for me (mostly) I always use cmake to enable/disable stuff.
But anyway, just enabling `CMAKE_EXPORT_COMPILE_COMMANDS` did not help by itself, intellisense probably needs path to json file, but I have no will to look for that at this moment.
Did try to install clangd, it was super simple and it works, so will be using that for a while
Wed, Sep 25, 2024, 11:50:32 - LazyDodo: just to check, have you seen https://developer.blender.org/docs/handbook/development_environments/vscode  ?
Wed, Sep 25, 2024, 11:51:30 - LazyDodo: cause it kinda feels you're re-discovering known issues
Wed, Sep 25, 2024, 12:15:46 - iss: I did see it, but I was using VS code "wrong" for long time and things did just work lol.
By wrong, it asked me to configure, so I clicked "sure, yes" then I clicked build button chose some GCC there and it did build... 0 configuration pretty much, so I was happy with that.
Wed, Sep 25, 2024, 12:16:41 - iss: but then (after like 6 months) clang format addon broke somehow and I could not make it work. So I checked the wiki...
Wed, Sep 25, 2024, 12:18:36 - iss: Probably skipped intellisense section, because I remember "disabling it" in MSVC. Well I disabled only error reporting. Still most things did work until I wanted to fiddle with some ffmpeg code when I noticed it being grayed out
Wed, Sep 25, 2024, 12:21:28 - iss sent an image. (Media omitted)

Wed, Sep 25, 2024, 12:23:55 - Hans Goudey: Oh it's a clang tidy suggestion
Wed, Sep 25, 2024, 12:26:58 - iss: quite strong suggestion :)
Wed, Sep 25, 2024, 12:27:50 - Hans Goudey: Well it's right that `typedef` is useless in C++, but for reasons we have our own C parser

Wed, Sep 25, 2024, 13:38:45 - iss: I also started looking for base64 strings and stuff :D
Wed, Sep 25, 2024, 13:40:50 - iss: Seems fine, but not sure what it is for guishe is this so we can have named enums in DNA? looks like it does some type magic as well, so I guess it tries to calculate size?
Wed, Sep 25, 2024, 13:40:59 - LazyDodo: whacha frowning about troubled hans being too quick or me admitting i did a shit job ? üôÇ
Wed, Sep 25, 2024, 13:41:46 - troubled: LazyDodo: the phrase "BF signed malware". You have enough credit to make some debits!
Wed, Sep 25, 2024, 13:42:08 - iss: worst case, you can stop the job...
Wed, Sep 25, 2024, 13:42:25 - LazyDodo: lol, like i go back for a second look once i kick off the bots ;0 
Wed, Sep 25, 2024, 13:42:29 - LazyDodo: like anyone goes back
Wed, Sep 25, 2024, 13:44:10 - LazyDodo: @iss plus that may already be too late, getting something to execute on the CI infra, is something you could get done in the first 30 sec of a build 
Wed, Sep 25, 2024, 13:45:39 - iss: True, you can sneak malware into build scripts...
Wed, Sep 25, 2024, 13:45:57 - LazyDodo: i was deliberately vague on the how
Wed, Sep 25, 2024, 13:46:00 - LazyDodo: but yes üôÇ
Wed, Sep 25, 2024, 13:46:03 - guishe: Yep, or to avoid making things like`char filepath[1024]; /* FILE_MAX */`, instead of just using the `char filepath[FILE_MAX ];`
Wed, Sep 25, 2024, 13:46:31 - iss: Oops I wanted to clarify, that you would have more success with different way but nevermind
Wed, Sep 25, 2024, 13:46:54 - troubled: I mean these days if you have a good enough exploit, you could sneak it into a favicon.ico or png, let alone a build script. And with AI being as good as it is, probably way more possible cases than we will soon be able to imagine
Wed, Sep 25, 2024, 13:46:58 - LazyDodo: i think we should probably not continue this conversation üôÇ 
Wed, Sep 25, 2024, 13:49:19 - iss: That would be great indeed. Not very versed in that area, the PR looks like half of compiler (by very quick check), so hope it is good :)
Wed, Sep 25, 2024, 14:50:29 - guishe: It don't calculates the size, it reads the size from the enum class definition like in: `enum class OperatorFlag: short{...};`
Wed, Sep 25, 2024, 15:01:54 - Jesse Y: Hans Goudey I think the tests/data hash is incorrect?
Wed, Sep 25, 2024, 15:03:04 - Hans Goudey: Sorry, just left for a run, will be back in an hour. Feel free to revert
Wed, Sep 25, 2024, 15:03:24 - Jesse Y: Let me try pointing at the "correct" one
Wed, Sep 25, 2024, 15:03:40 - zazizizou: Any chance my half commit contributed to the wrong hash? https://projects.blender.org/blender/blender/pulls/127316 
Wed, Sep 25, 2024, 15:04:02 - zazizizou: committed in `tests/data` but not into the main repo
Wed, Sep 25, 2024, 15:09:23 - Jesse Y: zazizizou Probably not, but leaving the half-committed state for several days isn't ideal as other commits will end up pulling it over.  
Wed, Sep 25, 2024, 15:10:42 - zazizizou: Ok, yeah just wanted to be around after I submit, because it‚Äôs probably triggering a flaky test 
Wed, Sep 25, 2024, 15:13:44 - Jesse Y: well that change is in main now.  Pulling over Han's change brought in yours as well as Jacques's changes... hope those are compatible with the code in main...
Wed, Sep 25, 2024, 15:35:30 - Jesse Y: zazizizou as feared the `compositor_output_cpu` is failing now. I guess the newly added files there were somehow not compatible with code in main?  I need to run to an errand now myself but the daily builds in 1h will probably fail.
Wed, Sep 25, 2024, 15:36:20 - zazizizou: Jesse Y: ok I‚Äôll submit the fix then
Wed, Sep 25, 2024, 15:50:56 - zazizizou: Jesse Y: a squash commit as is would break the build right? https://projects.blender.org/blender/blender/pulls/127316#issuecomment-1302748
Wed, Sep 25, 2024, 16:26:42 - Hans Goudey: Okay now it's just the compositor test failing I think that must be something else?
Wed, Sep 25, 2024, 16:38:28 - zazizizou: Just submitted the PR. Should be fixed now
Wed, Sep 25, 2024, 16:46:14 - LazyDodo: for anyone getting

Wed, Sep 25, 2024, 16:46:20 - LazyDodo: while pulling, just pull again, it'll go away
Wed, Sep 25, 2024, 17:27:04 - Jesse Y: Could we re-kick the primary daily package builds with recent main? The build from yesterday was affected by a pretty bad selection bug.
Wed, Sep 25, 2024, 20:07:52 - guishe: It's just me who gets this warning? (i dont see them in build-bot checks)

https://builder.blender.org/admin/#/builders/133/builds/7236
Wed, Sep 25, 2024, 20:10:43 - Jesse Y: It was mentioned to cycles folks earlier today, but yeah needs fixing.
Wed, Sep 25, 2024, 21:16:52 - LazyDodo: guishe:  buildbots are incremental builds, you'll get the warn once, and then not again until the file or one of its headers changes again
Wed, Sep 25, 2024, 21:17:04 - LazyDodo: not seeing it on the bots doesn't mean a whole lot
Thu, Sep 26, 2024, 00:52:18 - Sergey: Gebuz. The bot is red all over the board https://builder.blender.org/dashboard

Thanks for fixing!
Thu, Sep 26, 2024, 03:17:31 - Lukas T√∂nne: is there a union operator for `blender::Set`?
Thu, Sep 26, 2024, 03:21:37 - Lukas T√∂nne: hm, i guess there's just `Set::add_multiple`, has a comment to optimize in future. good enough for now
Thu, Sep 26, 2024, 04:22:06 - innactpro joined the room
Thu, Sep 26, 2024, 04:40:29 - LazyDodo: Sergey: best guess someone pushed a bad hash? and git no-likey? 
Thu, Sep 26, 2024, 04:56:23 - Sergey: LazyDodo: Yeah, i just a bit surprised it affected v330 v360 and v420. But maybe some parts in Git happens before it actually know which branch you're pulling into
Thu, Sep 26, 2024, 05:33:30 - LazyDodo: Sergey: maybe we could validate the hash in a server side hook and reject the push? i mean i won't say this sort of thing happens a lot, but it's definitely not the first time, or second or third
Thu, Sep 26, 2024, 05:37:53 - Sergey: LazyDodo: Would be good, yes. Thing i am not sure is whether it's possible to check whether commit exists without cloning the repo.  but worst case can hardcode some paths on local drive 
Thu, Sep 26, 2024, 05:39:56 - LazyDodo: yeah yikes hadn't thought about that, doing a pull on 5 repo's for every commit will likely not have performance characteristics we'd enjoy 
Thu, Sep 26, 2024, 06:08:31 - Wu Yiming: Ehhh extension people, is there any design task or something related to the extension platform potentially supporting multiple versions of python in the future? Or at least something I can [point those people to](https://projects.blender.org/blender/blender/issues/127090#issuecomment-1303354)? Because sooner or later it's gonna become a problem when we upgrade python version for blender
Thu, Sep 26, 2024, 06:11:28 - LazyDodo: we'll be on this version till atleast 2026, but yeah this has come up with distro builds where they may not ship our python version
Thu, Sep 26, 2024, 06:12:59 - LazyDodo: Dalai Felinto: ^^
Thu, Sep 26, 2024, 06:31:11 - Sebastian Parborg: With all of the GIL work going on in python currently I think we probably want to move sooner rather than later.
(Both for performance reasons and so we can have more incremental changes on our side of the code)
Thu, Sep 26, 2024, 06:31:38 - LazyDodo: Sebastian Parborg: vfxplatform says : no
Thu, Sep 26, 2024, 06:31:48 - LazyDodo: 2026 at the earliest
Thu, Sep 26, 2024, 06:32:22 - Wu Yiming: but before 2026 you would already have higher non-LTS versions, we keep those versions on 3.11 still?
Thu, Sep 26, 2024, 06:32:42 - Wu Yiming: I'd imaging those versions would have already upgraded to higher version of python and they also need to download their extension
Thu, Sep 26, 2024, 06:32:58 - LazyDodo: we never bump python version on an lts patch level yes, major python version not an option, that would ruin the whole point of LTS
Thu, Sep 26, 2024, 06:33:16 - Wu Yiming: Huh then it's probably alright...
Thu, Sep 26, 2024, 06:33:38 - Julian Eisel: Sergey: can you try this? (see thread)

Thu, Sep 26, 2024, 06:34:17 - Nika Kutsniashvili: I'm confused why Blender comes with 3.12 for Linux and 3.11 for win/mac?
Thu, Sep 26, 2024, 06:34:54 - LazyDodo: Nika Kutsniashvili: our builds vs lets say an arch or debian package, _we_ ship very specific versions, but we can't force the rest of the work to ship those versions as well
Thu, Sep 26, 2024, 06:35:56 - Nika Kutsniashvili: We talked briefly about add-on which tried to ship python 3.12 in the package and decided we wouldn't allow that and ask them to follow vfx guidelines and use 3.11. I'm guessing answer should be same here
Thu, Sep 26, 2024, 06:36:09 - LazyDodo: especially on environments like arch, where everything is "latest" you'll have quite the challange of getting them to ship py 3.11 till 2026 and they will have blender build against newer versions
Thu, Sep 26, 2024, 06:36:43 - Sergey: Julian Eisel: Want to review https://projects.blender.org/blender/blender/pulls/128189 and give your 2c about whether it should be in 4.2?
Thu, Sep 26, 2024, 06:37:24 - Wu Yiming: ü§í will blender run correctly with an arbitrarily newer py version? Since internal scripts don't have binary stuff and don't use obscure libraries
Thu, Sep 26, 2024, 06:38:08 - LazyDodo: sometimes requires patches, but that's not our problem, they want to ship new stuff, they get to do the work
Thu, Sep 26, 2024, 06:38:48 - LazyDodo: not uncommon for them to submit patches though, which we do land, if we _can_ make life easier downstream we certainly will
Thu, Sep 26, 2024, 06:39:08 - Sergey: Still the same
Thu, Sep 26, 2024, 06:39:15 - Sergey: also, think it is "in the future"

Thu, Sep 26, 2024, 07:31:30 - LazyDodo: dr.sybren: heads up : it's a flaky test, will _usually_ pass, but _sometimes_ fail
Thu, Sep 26, 2024, 07:31:52 - LazyDodo: what i'm saying is: don't write off 'works for me' too soon
Thu, Sep 26, 2024, 07:36:46 - Sergey: Bastien Montagne: yeah, but i can not repro locally, and i can not really understand how's that possible
Thu, Sep 26, 2024, 07:44:48 - LazyDodo: Sergey: there is a bunch of other files with similar problems already in `tests\python\bl_blendfile_versioning.py`  we could just go LAAALLLALALALAL ignore the problem and add it....
Thu, Sep 26, 2024, 07:45:29 - Sergey: That entire `bl_blendfile_versioning.py` is like designed to make it hard to troubleshoot issues
Thu, Sep 26, 2024, 07:51:26 - Sergey: Bastien Montagne: When you have nothing else to do, you can run that entire test with valgrind and run into

Thu, Sep 26, 2024, 07:54:06 - dr.Sybren: <@mont29:blender.org "dr.sybren: Nathan Vegdahl that c..."> Bastien Montagne do you have time to write a bug report about this? Some other work is taking me longer than expected, and I have to run off to host the module meeting soon.
Thu, Sep 26, 2024, 07:54:44 - Bastien Montagne: This code is simply opening and closing files... there is no intrinsic reasons for it to be 'flacky' or 'designed to be hard to troubleshoot issues'. The fact that some errors happen unreliably like that is fairly worrying about state/quality of our code though ;(
Thu, Sep 26, 2024, 07:56:29 - Sergey: Bastien Montagne: Sure it just opens and closes files. But makes it hard to know which of the files caused leak. And the thing like above is also not that trivial to deduct where it is originating from
Thu, Sep 26, 2024, 07:56:58 - Sergey: Looking into failing tests should not become a detective work to figure out what is the isolated case to repro the issue
Thu, Sep 26, 2024, 07:57:03 - Bastien Montagne: it litterally gives you the file it's going to open... not sure what else you want here?
Thu, Sep 26, 2024, 07:58:19 - Sergey: to start: know which file caused leak
Thu, Sep 26, 2024, 07:59:19 - Bastien Montagne: @Sergey what do you not get from this:
```
Trying to open /home/blender/git/blender-vdev/blender.git/tests/data/io_tests/blend_scene/all_curves.blend
Blender quit
...
```
Thu, Sep 26, 2024, 07:59:33 - Bastien Montagne: Ite gives you the list of files it opens, last one listed is the one that crashes!
Thu, Sep 26, 2024, 08:00:09 - Sergey: nothing is crashing
Thu, Sep 26, 2024, 08:00:22 - Bastien Montagne: eeeeeeeeek
Thu, Sep 26, 2024, 08:00:36 - Sergey: it is one blender instance, with a leak coming from some file
Thu, Sep 26, 2024, 08:00:49 - Bastien Montagne: yeaaaaaaahhhh right ‚òπÔ∏è
Thu, Sep 26, 2024, 08:00:51 - Bastien Montagne: pfffff
Thu, Sep 26, 2024, 08:01:12 - Bastien Montagne: and we _do not_ want to open/close blender for each of these hundreds of files ‚òπÔ∏è
Thu, Sep 26, 2024, 08:01:34 - Sergey: there needs to be a mode for this
Thu, Sep 26, 2024, 08:01:55 - Sergey: it took me 2 years to convince Brecht that it is the greatest debugging option.
Shall i take 2 more to convince you now? ;)
Thu, Sep 26, 2024, 08:02:14 - Bastien Montagne: could add an option yes... but still, if we cannot reproduce reliably locally...
Thu, Sep 26, 2024, 08:02:30 - Sergey: Foe render tests we use `WITH_TESTS_BATCHED`
Thu, Sep 26, 2024, 08:02:43 - Sergey: when something crashes, or acts up, set it to False and life is so much easier
Thu, Sep 26, 2024, 08:03:12 - Sergey: Bastien Montagne: Yeah, that is the initial question i had. Whether you was able to repro
Thu, Sep 26, 2024, 08:03:17 - LazyDodo: unreliable tests is why ctest's `--repeat until-fail` exists, it'll be painful regardless, but there are tools
Thu, Sep 26, 2024, 08:03:21 - Bastien Montagne: we could just use the same for these tests too
Thu, Sep 26, 2024, 08:03:23 - Sergey: Maybe you're more lucky in threading timing or something
Thu, Sep 26, 2024, 08:03:52 - Bastien Montagne: will have a look at that
Thu, Sep 26, 2024, 08:04:10 - Bastien Montagne: (when time allows üôÑ)
Thu, Sep 26, 2024, 08:05:04 - Sergey: Running the entire test with valgrind reproduced the leak. But not opening the files individually. But. Maybe i am opening the wrong file. Or, maybe the file is not OPENING, but APPENDING/LINKING ü§î
Thu, Sep 26, 2024, 08:05:25 - Bastien Montagne: could also be that indeed
Thu, Sep 26, 2024, 08:06:13 - Sergey: <@lazydodo:blender.org "unreliable tests is why ctest's ..."> Well, yeah. But i had no luck with that locally. So.. Fun
Thu, Sep 26, 2024, 08:06:31 - Sergey: Not sure it's useful to wait for the entire 9999999 to finish :)
Thu, Sep 26, 2024, 08:07:41 - LazyDodo: yeah... race conditions are gonna race, worst i had i think was 90 minutes for a single repro, _most_ of the time, less than 10 minutes
Thu, Sep 26, 2024, 08:09:46 - LazyDodo: if it _is_ a race i find it does help if you just keep the cores busy before starting the repro (ie spin up N cores of , while(1) do_spinlock()) 
Thu, Sep 26, 2024, 08:10:45 - LazyDodo: but in the end, yeah, they are crappy problems, and luck is certainly involved
Thu, Sep 26, 2024, 09:25:37 - povmaniac: I have a maybe dummy( or not) question.. is ethic or legal to share a screen capture of this chat with others?
Thu, Sep 26, 2024, 09:26:39 - povmaniac: Good afternoon, btw :)

Thu, Sep 26, 2024, 09:29:10 - povmaniac: At least a point of view :)
Thu, Sep 26, 2024, 09:31:41 - LazyDodo: i personally see this place as a public space, if you don't want to be seen by others saying things, don't say them in public, doubt there's any legal basis that prevents you from doing anything with the publically available data
Thu, Sep 26, 2024, 09:31:42 - povmaniac: The idea is emphasize or demonstrate to another person that I really asked a question here and got a concrete answer. Or maybe I should send that person away for not trusting my word?.
Thu, Sep 26, 2024, 09:31:56 - LazyDodo: on the other hand, it's really easy to take things out of context
Thu, Sep 26, 2024, 09:32:15 - LazyDodo: so you'll never get a blanket ok ethically to post screenshots all over the place
Thu, Sep 26, 2024, 09:33:03 - LazyDodo: any ethical answer you get will be "some random persons opinion" at best anyhow, so holds no value
Thu, Sep 26, 2024, 09:33:25 - LazyDodo: lazy said it was ok, will sway no-one
Thu, Sep 26, 2024, 09:37:17 - LazyDodo: also of note, if you're looking to turn this place into a big'ol ask the devs random things place, not what this channel is for

Thu, Sep 26, 2024, 14:40:44 - sensarice: Could the main branch encounter compilation errors after an update? If so, I would choose to make changes and test the new code on the release branch.
Thu, Sep 26, 2024, 16:54:48 - Alaska: Yes, the main branch can encounter compilation errors after a update. Either due to an unintentional breaking change, or an intentional change (E.g. a library update) that your incremental build system couldn't figure out.
Thu, Sep 26, 2024, 16:56:28 - Alaska: Developing and testing in a release branch is alright, as long as you make pull requests against the right branch when you submit it for review.

Thu, Sep 26, 2024, 18:43:09 - badcrow: Does anyone have info about the old Node Preview feature in development for 4.1 alpha/beta a while ago? 
Thu, Sep 26, 2024, 18:56:40 - Jesse Y: It's still an "experimental" feature. GSoC student wasn't able to contribute more time for it and neither have the other devs. I think it was mostly performance related problems that needed solving and more testing.

Fri, Sep 27, 2024, 03:46:10 - Jacques Lucke: There is a test failure in `main` that I can't make sense of right now. I can't see how the last commit could possibly cause this given that the code in question is not used by any tests yet I think. And even if, the test failure seems unrelated.
When I run the tests locally, they succeed.
Fri, Sep 27, 2024, 07:22:48 - Wu Yiming: OK I think now actually got my blender into that weird state for the first time where no shortcut keys are registering... no regular keys, not ctrl/alt/shift combinations... UI still responses to mouse clicks, middle mouse still pans around, right click also works
Fri, Sep 27, 2024, 07:23:05 - Wu Yiming: But I'm pretty sure when I launch it again I can't reproduce that
Fri, Sep 27, 2024, 07:23:22 - sensarice: Is there any code available for a "new shader image texture node" that would allow the use of image interfaces and image info nodes within material nodes, similar to what we have with geometry nodes? I want to try implementing my feature request with it.
Fri, Sep 27, 2024, 07:25:21 - sensarice: If the "new material image texture node" has not yet been completed, I hope it can be merged as soon as possible, as this would advance my plans.

Fri, Sep 27, 2024, 08:46:09 - Jacques Lucke: yes
Fri, Sep 27, 2024, 08:46:50 - zazizizou: I came across the same error and it seems to be a known issue (see `bl_blendfile_versioning.py`):
```
# WARNING(@ideasman42): some blend files causes the tests to fail (seemingly) at random (on Linux & macOS at least).

```
Fri, Sep 27, 2024, 08:52:19 - sensarice: Regarding the use of the same image nodes in shaders as in geometry, I've heard that someone has been developing or attempting this. I would like to know if anyone is still working on it, as it seems that this request already exists on the RCS .
Fri, Sep 27, 2024, 08:53:07 - Hans Goudey: sensarice No one has been working on this
Fri, Sep 27, 2024, 09:43:27 - troubled: I rerouted the mail for the Microsoft TLDs via Gmail which appears to have addressed the IP reputation problem for at least some of the Microsoft domains, specifically the ones I seen sitting on the queue. Other TLDs, namely country specific ones will likely still sit for a while until I can address the new TLD, or until MS stops disliking our IP.

Sorry for the mail delays!
Fri, Sep 27, 2024, 10:41:25 - sensarice: I came across your post about storing string attributes in geometry data. Are you still working on this? I would like to try storing ptr (pointers) in the geometry data to point to any type of data, such as objects, images, or documents.

Fri, Sep 27, 2024, 10:42:47 - Iliya Katushenock: There is no use case for string attributes currently, this is the reason of lack of them

Sun, Sep 29, 2024, 05:19:51 - epai: Good evening, everyone. I have a question.

According to my understanding, the lightbake_render_world_face function in eevee_lightprobes.cc renders a two-dimensional exr image file (such as city.exr) onto the six faces of a cube. Then use this cube as the background, and use this background as the viewport background and the source of lighting information in space.

I compiled and ran it on Windows, and called GPU_framebuffer_bind and GPU_framebuffer_read_color after this function to save the frame rendering results to the image file, and the result was the same as the viewport rendering effect.

Now my problem is that when I change to other platforms, the saved image files are always empty. I have printed a lot of logs to check whether the call to the opengl interface is successful, but I don't see any error codes.

Can you provide some ideas, suggestions, and clues to help me troubleshoot it?
Sun, Sep 29, 2024, 12:17:33 - Coalth: silly question maybe, but what's the best way to print stuff to the terminal from within the C/C++ codebase? import std::cout or is there a better option within bke?
Sun, Sep 29, 2024, 12:17:50 - Coalth: *or BLI
Sun, Sep 29, 2024, 12:28:17 - Sean Kim: Yeah, I just use `std::cout` or `printf`, depending on if there's a type that I'm interested in has an appropriate overload 
Sun, Sep 29, 2024, 12:36:30 - LazyDodo: `<<`is the shift operator, C++ deciding it's the way to print, does not compute and i refuse to bend to this insanity, printf all the way üôÇ
Sun, Sep 29, 2024, 12:38:17 - Iliya Katushenock: If by _best_ you means speed its better to use `std::stringstream` to collect all outputs first and `std::cout << stream.str()` in the end.
Sun, Sep 29, 2024, 12:41:08 - Sean Kim: We just need to wait until we can use C++23 and get `std::print` 
Sun, Sep 29, 2024, 12:41:50 - Sean Kim: Maybe in 10 years depending on the VFX platform speed üòÖ
Sun, Sep 29, 2024, 12:53:52 - Jesse Y: Use fmt::print
Sun, Sep 29, 2024, 13:04:26 - Hans Goudey: fmt is a required dependency we should basically use it everywhere IMO
Sun, Sep 29, 2024, 13:08:32 - Sean Kim: Good to know
Sun, Sep 29, 2024, 13:09:39 - Jesse Y: Though `fmt` is, ironically, going to be our biggest blocker from easily updating to c++20 when that time arrives.
Sun, Sep 29, 2024, 13:12:52 - LazyDodo: what's the blocker there? it's namespaced so i don't see it colliding with std::format ?
Sun, Sep 29, 2024, 13:14:04 - Jesse Y: https://godbolt.org/z/G1PP85G6a
Sun, Sep 29, 2024, 13:15:20 - Jesse Y: Not strictly blocked. Just "we need to come up with a policy of how we want our 12345 callsites to look like and then change those 12345 callsites"
Sun, Sep 29, 2024, 13:17:49 - LazyDodo: given vfxplatform, we'll likely have another 15 years to sort that out
Sun, Sep 29, 2024, 13:19:39 - Jesse Y: I think at the app-level we're free to use c++20 if we want. We don't provide a c++ "SDK" so folks won't be consuming our interfaces. We could try to go to 20 if we want though we'd probably want to bump the various compilers slightly ahead.
Sun, Sep 29, 2024, 13:20:04 - Jesse Y: In any case, that `fmt` issue is the only thing stopping a 1 line cmake change.
Sun, Sep 29, 2024, 13:20:24 - Coalth: lol thanks for the answers guys
Sun, Sep 29, 2024, 13:21:06 - Coalth: Sean Kim: do you have an example of a type with an 'appropriate overload'?
Sun, Sep 29, 2024, 13:26:42 - Sean Kim: Coalth: `VecBase` derived classes mainly, i.e. `float3`, `float4`
Sun, Sep 29, 2024, 13:30:01 - Coalth: cool thank you!

Mon, Sep 30, 2024, 07:24:56 - Jacques Lucke: seems to work again
Mon, Sep 30, 2024, 07:32:22 - Arnd: Not sure what was going on there. There's no specific max-connections listed for that site in apache, but there was/is quite some traffic from one particular host in Japan today; 13000 requests. Next lower down's 8764, then 4760. Seems a bit excessive. Might have been it, but hard to check timeline with just grep atm
Mon, Sep 30, 2024, 07:33:00 - Arnd: The studio-IP only manages to get 3972 requests
Mon, Sep 30, 2024, 07:45:33 - Arnd: and WHILE i'm looking at the (right) log, i see it happening again.
Mon, Sep 30, 2024, 07:46:43 - Arnd: and its indeed the japanese IPV6 address

Tue, Oct 1, 2024, 03:50:08 - Arnd: There's a tonne of traffic directed at URLS that dont make sense or pull a heavy load. A number of chinese ASN's involved, Filtering/mitigating/rate-limiting. Machine's not having fun
Tue, Oct 1, 2024, 03:59:32 - Arnd: It very much looks like someone's doing a scraping-run on old developer.blender.org urls. This might be coincidental, as there's also a lot of distributed access to www.blender.org/  which is more indicative of a DDoS. DNS-traffic to our zone seems to agree. Next to that, there are some misconfigured scrapers doing some weiiird behaviour
Tue, Oct 1, 2024, 05:33:28 - Arnd: If i am not mistaking, most/all sites should be responsive once again (except developer.blender.org...). Let me know *here* if there are issues.
Tue, Oct 1, 2024, 05:35:25 - frogstomp: thanks Arnd  seems fine now.
Tue, Oct 1, 2024, 05:38:10 - frogstomp sent an image. (Media omitted)
Tue, Oct 1, 2024, 05:38:11 - frogstomp: Don't know where or which person to ask this, maybe Pablo Vazquez ? I've submitted 100+ bug reports since platform change.. I'd like to ask to have this field set to 500px+ height... When resized it jumps back to original form and it is very annoying.


Tue, Oct 1, 2024, 05:50:06 - dr.Sybren: Hey folks! Did something change with `BLI_assert` in release-mode builds? I'm getting this crash when running a release-mode unit test:

```
103: BLI_assert failed: blender/source/blender/blenkernel/intern/library.cc:312, BKE_library_main_rebuild_hierarchy(), at 'lib_iter->runtime.temp_index == 0'
```

So do BLI\_asserts now also abort in release builds?
Tue, Oct 1, 2024, 05:50:37 - Sergey: there is a CMake option for that
Tue, Oct 1, 2024, 05:50:57 - Sergey: `WITH_ASSERT_RELEASE` is OFF by default. And it was there for al long long time
Tue, Oct 1, 2024, 05:51:14 - dr.Sybren: Interestingly enough, my `CMakeCache.txt` has ` WITH_ASSERT_RELEASE:BOOL=OFF` 
Tue, Oct 1, 2024, 05:52:23 - Sergey: and you've checked `CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE` is `Release` ?
Tue, Oct 1, 2024, 05:53:00 - dr.Sybren: whhhhhaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa for some reason my release build directory became a debug build üòø
Tue, Oct 1, 2024, 05:53:36 - Sergey: it has failed save vs debug throw
Tue, Oct 1, 2024, 05:53:44 - dr.Sybren: lol yeah

This is probably because recent versions of libtiff have removed those: https://gitlab.com/libtiff/libtiff/-/issues/511 .  I'm going to go ahead and open a PR and hope the automated build system doesn't fail.
Tue, Oct 1, 2024, 13:57:54 - Iliya Katushenock: Did you run `make update` in a root of your local fork of blender? Did it was successful?

The only thing i liked from them, at least back then, was SELINUX, which I coulkd use under debian or ubuntu just fine. But with apparmor, and the upstream shipping reasonible defaults, there was little need for even that.

I will say though that their package tool felt very polished compared to dpkg/apt/apt-get/dselect etc!

Wed, Oct 2, 2024, 03:57:29 - Anthony Roberts: As a follow-on from this, I was looking at how best to detect whether a user has a WoA device or not, mainly because I can see the problem of people downloading the wrong arch becoming much more pronounced once WoA becomes a proper release version

The TL;DR is it's impossible on Firefox as it intentionally anonymises those values, but on Chromium browsers (ie. edge, chrome, etc), you can use the following snippet:

```

Wed, Oct 2, 2024, 05:08:55 - Sergey: Thomas Dinges: The regression tests will not let 4.3 to come through. `animrig` and `bl_animation_keyframing` are not passing when `WITH_EXPERIMENTAL_FEATURES=OFF`
Wed, Oct 2, 2024, 05:09:39 - Thomas Dinges: Nathan Vegdahl: Christoph Lendenfeld Can one of you please check?
Wed, Oct 2, 2024, 05:10:26 - Sergey: Nathan is day off on Wednesday. But hopefully Christoph is around :)
Wed, Oct 2, 2024, 05:12:46 - Falk David: Looking into it as well. I think a simple `#ifdef WITH_ANIM_BAKLAVA` will fix it
Wed, Oct 2, 2024, 05:13:11 - Sergey: Fix in what sense?
Wed, Oct 2, 2024, 05:13:30 - Falk David: make the test not run because it's meant to be used with experimental features on
Wed, Oct 2, 2024, 05:13:45 - Sergey: But is it the test at fault, or the code?
Wed, Oct 2, 2024, 05:15:22 - Falk David: I think the test is fine
Wed, Oct 2, 2024, 05:15:54 - Sergey: If the test is fine then the error is in the actual code. And disabling test will make it so we ship Blender with essentially broken animation
Wed, Oct 2, 2024, 05:17:31 - Falk David: The `test_fcurve_move_layered` seems to also have been disabled for the same reason from what I can tell
Wed, Oct 2, 2024, 05:18:04 - Falk David: And there is https://projects.blender.org/blender/blender/pulls/127840
Wed, Oct 2, 2024, 05:18:21 - Falk David: maybe that gives us a clue
Wed, Oct 2, 2024, 05:21:18 - Sergey: The solution is simple implementaiton-wise: either ifdef test code, or un-ifdef some logic code.
The decision should be based on an a design, not on a clues or looking what is done to other tests (different tests might have different reasonings)
Wed, Oct 2, 2024, 05:24:32 - Sergey: And while the `animrig` test is testing some internals which are not exposed to the public API, the fact that `bl_animation_keyframing` fails with some logical errors (and not with undefined API due to disabled feature) kinda leans towards the possibility of mistake being in the code 
Wed, Oct 2, 2024, 05:25:20 - Falk David: That's true yea
Wed, Oct 2, 2024, 05:25:37 - Falk David: Didn't see the `bl_animation_keyframing` failiures
Wed, Oct 2, 2024, 05:30:45 - dr.Sybren: Sergey Falk David   I can remote to my work machine and take a look 
Wed, Oct 2, 2024, 05:31:27 - Sergey: dr.Sybren: You'd have a lot hugs and loves
Wed, Oct 2, 2024, 05:32:09 - Falk David: dr.Sybren Link to the test logs for convenience: https://builder.blender.org/admin/#/builders/274/builds/1/steps/6/logs/stdio
Wed, Oct 2, 2024, 05:48:02 - Lukas T√∂nne: what is `tools/utils_maintenance/blender_menu_search_coverage.py` used for?
Wed, Oct 2, 2024, 05:48:41 - dr.Sybren: Sergey `WITH_ANIM_BAKLAVA` protects enough to prevent any user from creating layered Actions. Even when they open a file that has layered Actions, they'll be automatically loaded as legacy Actions.

The unit test is explicitly making layered Actions, though, so I can either disable the test (fastest way to get the build to succeed) or enable enough code to make it work (safest way to get longer-term stable code).

The reason not _everything_ is hidden between `#ifdef WITH_ANIM_BAKLAVA` is that it would create rather hard to read code, and make a confusing process (digging through the legacy animation code) even harder.
Wed, Oct 2, 2024, 05:53:02 - Thomas Dinges: We are talking about 4.3 which is now in feature freeze, so for this branch we can just disable the test then?
Wed, Oct 2, 2024, 05:53:33 - Sergey: dr.Sybren: Does not really explain failure of `bl_animation_keyframing`
Wed, Oct 2, 2024, 05:53:56 - dr.Sybren: Will look into that next
Wed, Oct 2, 2024, 05:54:12 - Sergey: Thomas Dinges: broh, lets find PROPER solution. Green is not always proper ;)
Wed, Oct 2, 2024, 05:54:28 - Sergey: I'd rather not have a build, than a build which will lead to broken .blend files
Wed, Oct 2, 2024, 05:55:08 - Thomas Dinges: I refered to the test Sybren mentioned. If this feature (layered actions) won't be in 4.3, I see no point having a test in 4.3 for that. 
Wed, Oct 2, 2024, 05:55:51 - dr.Sybren: Thomas Dinges the changes to the animation system are much more invasive than just legacy vs. layered Actions. The whole flow of (un)assigning Actions has been reimplemented. I'd rather have more tests than less.
Wed, Oct 2, 2024, 05:56:27 - Sergey: Thomas Dinges: See my comment above, about two tests failing, and that failure of one of them is not really explainable
Wed, Oct 2, 2024, 05:56:45 - Thomas Dinges: I let you figure this one out then :) 
Wed, Oct 2, 2024, 05:56:52 - Sergey: I see no point in trying to rush proper investigaiton
Wed, Oct 2, 2024, 06:00:00 - Sergey: dr.Sybren: Something like this could be useful in the future:
```
#ifdef WITH_ANIM_BAKLAVA
#  define SKIP_IF_NO_BAKLAVA() \
    do { \
    } while (false)
#else
#  define SKIP_IF_NO_BAKLAVA() \
    GTEST_SKIP() \
        << "Test requires BAKLAVA (which is actually Layered Actions, but global stirng " \
           "search-n-replace has failed some time ago, but now its easier to simply ignore)"
#endif
```
Wed, Oct 2, 2024, 06:00:05 - dr.Sybren: <@sergey:blender.org "dr.Sybren: Does not really expla..."> oh that's easily explained by me being a muppet
Wed, Oct 2, 2024, 06:00:17 - Sergey: And then you do
```
TEST_F(ActionLayersTest, add_layer)
{
  SKIP_IF_NO_BAKLAVA();
  ...
```
Wed, Oct 2, 2024, 06:01:05 - Sergey: <@dr.sybren:blender.org "oh that's easily explained by me..."> Sure, but that's different explanation from chee poo poo tests explicitly creating layered actions, no? ;)
Wed, Oct 2, 2024, 06:01:42 - dr.Sybren: Earlier this week I was bright enough to make the same key insertion unit test work with both the experimental flag (in prefs) on and off. But I forgot to make it NOT run the with-experimental-flag-enabled test in non-experimental builds.
Wed, Oct 2, 2024, 06:02:00 - dr.Sybren: (ok that's enough negations in the same sentence)
Wed, Oct 2, 2024, 06:02:22 - Sergey: `NOT !(!expr)`
Wed, Oct 2, 2024, 06:03:22 - Sergey: dr.Sybren: so it is also solvable by disabling some test, and that is the proper solution?
Wed, Oct 2, 2024, 06:03:54 - dr.Sybren: yup, that's just figuring out how to get Python to know that we built without Baklava, and skipping that entire test class.
Wed, Oct 2, 2024, 06:05:07 - dr.Sybren: `if hasattr(bpy.types, 'ActionSlot'): ...` should do it
Wed, Oct 2, 2024, 06:06:25 - Sergey: dr.Sybren: I am still not fully sure why the same API leads to different results, but i'll let you cook, and we can talk details tomorrow
Wed, Oct 2, 2024, 06:08:24 - dr.Sybren: <@sergey:blender.org "dr.Sybren: I am still not fully ..."> It's very weird that it fails indeed... :/

I've been under the assumption that all experimental flags in the preferences would be hard-coded to 'false' when built without experimental features.  Is that not the case?
Wed, Oct 2, 2024, 06:09:16 - Sergey: dr.Sybren: no, because SOME experimental options are available in releases
Wed, Oct 2, 2024, 06:09:29 - dr.Sybren: ahw shit
Wed, Oct 2, 2024, 06:09:47 - dr.Sybren: ok, then some more `#ifdef WITH_ANIM_BAKLAVA` is needed
Wed, Oct 2, 2024, 06:10:20 - Falk David: <@sergey:blender.org "dr.Sybren: no, because SOME expe..."> wait what?
Wed, Oct 2, 2024, 06:10:51 - Falk David: `BLO_sanitize_experimental_features_userpref_blend`
Wed, Oct 2, 2024, 06:11:27 - Falk David: Everything after `SANITIZE_AFTER_HERE` in `UserDef_Experimental` is set to be `0`
Wed, Oct 2, 2024, 06:13:00 - dr.Sybren: Falk David apparently that's only on read, and setting via Python/RNA is still possible
Wed, Oct 2, 2024, 06:14:25 - Falk David: yea that's true, they can still be set via python
Wed, Oct 2, 2024, 06:16:25 - dr.Sybren: I'll guard the RNA property with `#ifdef WITH_ANIM_BAKLAVA` as well, then, because a bunch of code assumes that non-experimental builds have this off.
Wed, Oct 2, 2024, 06:18:40 - dr.Sybren: hmmm now `bl_animation_nla_strip` fails with:

```
BLI_assert failed: blender/source/blender/blenkernel/intern/library.cc:312, BKE_library_main_rebuild_hierarchy(), at 'lib_iter->runtime.temp_index == 0'
```

(my non-experimental build dir is in debug mode)
Not sure what this error means though.
Wed, Oct 2, 2024, 06:20:34 - Sergey: dr.Sybren: Make a PR againt 4.3, poke CI, if that is green, ship? :D
Wed, Oct 2, 2024, 06:20:39 - dr.Sybren: it's the same error as reported in [#123769: Assert when saving a file with deleted workspaces](https://projects.blender.org/blender/blender/issues/123769)

Wed, Oct 2, 2024, 06:23:13 - Sergey: But it'd have been done the proper thing of always returning false in builds without experimental features (would still allow to write to it though)

Wed, Oct 2, 2024, 07:29:28 - dr.Sybren: Sergey lemme add the `Pull Request: {url}` thingy to the independent commits, Gitea doesn't do that automatically
Wed, Oct 2, 2024, 07:33:03 - dr.Sybren: Sergey Thomas Dinges LazyDodo landed! 4.3 buildbot should be all green again. Sorry for the noise!
Wed, Oct 2, 2024, 07:33:23 - dr.Sybren: I'll now do the branch merge back to `main`

Wed, Oct 2, 2024, 13:23:23 - Jesse Y: LazyDodo Are the following 2 issues indicative of TBB issues on Win 24H2 release?
https://projects.blender.org/blender/blender/issues/126109 and now https://projects.blender.org/blender/blender/issues/128502
Wed, Oct 2, 2024, 13:24:43 - LazyDodo: that's tbb malloc failing to inject it self 
Wed, Oct 2, 2024, 13:25:11 - LazyDodo: blender will run fine, but memory allocation won't be as performant
Wed, Oct 2, 2024, 13:26:27 - LazyDodo: that being said the biggest pain-point has been removed there, cycles original BVH builder was notoriously bad doing a large amount of small allocations from all threads which caused some severe lock contention in the standard allocator 
Wed, Oct 2, 2024, 13:26:28 - Jesse Y: right
Wed, Oct 2, 2024, 13:27:06 - LazyDodo: that was the main reason for having tbb malloc, but ever since we moved to embree it should no longer be an issue
Wed, Oct 2, 2024, 13:27:26 - Jesse Y: the rest of blender likes to alloc too though :)   We might be stuck until onetbb
Wed, Oct 2, 2024, 13:27:55 - LazyDodo: that be sooner than you think, once i finish off the 4.3 libs that be the last release of this year
Wed, Oct 2, 2024, 13:28:44 - LazyDodo: we'd be free to move to onetbb for main
Wed, Oct 2, 2024, 13:30:59 - Jesse Y: If it's indeed 24h2 related, would we remove it for 3.6/4.2 to prevent folks filing bugs when their windows updates?
Wed, Oct 2, 2024, 13:31:42 - LazyDodo: don't have time right now, but i'd probably look at the tbb tracker to see if it's a known issue
Wed, Oct 2, 2024, 13:32:17 - LazyDodo: we can always backport small patches if we have to
Wed, Oct 2, 2024, 13:34:26 - LazyDodo: https://github.com/oneapi-src/oneTBB/pull/1478
Wed, Oct 2, 2024, 13:34:31 - LazyDodo: that looks relevant
Wed, Oct 2, 2024, 13:38:37 - LazyDodo: not super thrilled about the way https://projects.blender.org/blender/blender/issues/126109 was handled
Wed, Oct 2, 2024, 13:38:42 - LazyDodo: hey i have a problem
Wed, Oct 2, 2024, 13:38:58 - LazyDodo: if you turn if off the problem, does it go away?
Wed, Oct 2, 2024, 13:39:00 - LazyDodo: ....
Wed, Oct 2, 2024, 13:39:43 - LazyDodo: i mean setting `TBB_MALLOC_DISABLE_REPLACEMENT` is a great diagnostic, but it's not _fixing_ any issues
Wed, Oct 2, 2024, 13:40:19 - LazyDodo: it's like going, hey i have issues rendering on the GPU, if you set it to CPU does it work?yes? excellent! ticket closed!
Wed, Oct 2, 2024, 20:41:54 - Aras Pranckeviƒçius: Is there a particular reason why TBB allocator is used, instead of some other ‚Äúmodern and fast‚Äù ones? (Like mimalloc or rpmalloc)

(And yes most of blender is fairly allocation-heavy, I would not expect that the standard system malloc would be good enough)
Wed, Oct 2, 2024, 20:48:19 - Jesse Y: I think mainly because it was "nearby" and we were using the rest of TBB anyhow.
Wed, Oct 2, 2024, 20:48:27 - Aras Pranckeviƒçius: Fair
Wed, Oct 2, 2024, 20:59:36 - LazyDodo: partially, it was nearby and offered a way to hook the memory allocator of the crt 
Wed, Oct 2, 2024, 21:06:22 - LazyDodo: looks like the msvc linker is still using tbbmalloc üôÇ 
Wed, Oct 2, 2024, 21:15:25 - LazyDodo: Aras Pranckeviƒçius: when we integrated it, there _were_ substantial savings ( https://archive.blender.org/developer/D6218 ) unsure if it still holds these days and how much as the BVH builder has been replaced with embree
Wed, Oct 2, 2024, 21:30:28 - Alaska: Cycles still builds it's own BVH implementation for GPUs when they're not using vendor supplied BVHs. Cycles own BVH is recommended for use on AMD GPUs, and macOS if you're on anything older than a M3 Processor.
Wed, Oct 2, 2024, 21:41:44 - Iliya Katushenock: would be good to just make it possible to allocate memory for tree only once instead of trying to speed up singlethread memory tree by modern heuristics\

In any case: What you want to do is go to the branch that you based your PR on (e.g. `main` or `blender-v4.3-release`) and then use `make update`. That will pull the right commit for the submodule. Then go to your PR branch and merge it with the base branch. Now when you push that merge commit, the change shouldn't show up in the PR anymore

Thu, Oct 3, 2024, 05:43:37 - LazyDodo: Sergey: didn't you enable Win/Arm64 yesterday on the bots for 4.3? i thought i saw a build float by that had it?
Thu, Oct 3, 2024, 06:06:52 - Sergey: LazyDodo: It should be in the nightly builds. But seems it has failed https://builder.blender.org/admin/#/builders/265/builds/13
Thu, Oct 3, 2024, 06:07:56 - Sergey: I've no idea how this code is only failing on one platforms. And it didn't use to fail
Thu, Oct 3, 2024, 06:19:00 - LazyDodo: ah nightly only still, yeah that'll do it
Thu, Oct 3, 2024, 06:22:15 - LazyDodo: Sergey: i can explain the why only this one platform, but not why it started failing, the why is, only windows uses manifests, and they are normally linked into the binary, clang on windows .... didn't like that for unknown reasons, so we went, screw it, external manifests it shall be then! but only when it detects clang, so x64 with msvc is still linking them, arm64 with clang will use external ones.
Thu, Oct 3, 2024, 07:37:18 - Sergey: LazyDodo: And its only failing for 4.3, and not for `main`
Thu, Oct 3, 2024, 07:39:24 - LazyDodo: do main and 4.3 share build folders?
Thu, Oct 3, 2024, 07:40:11 - LazyDodo: if not, maybe the file is already in place for main and cmake doesn't try to copy it, and doesn't run into trouble? \[/wild guess\]
Thu, Oct 3, 2024, 07:40:19 - Sergey: no
Thu, Oct 3, 2024, 07:40:47 - Sergey: but, the build folder for main was not fully erased when we've switched to clang-cl
Thu, Oct 3, 2024, 07:41:33 - LazyDodo: one part of me says, just let Anthony Roberts take a look before doing anything else
Thu, Oct 3, 2024, 07:41:53 - LazyDodo: other part of me is going, "wipe the build folder  and lets break main! "
Thu, Oct 3, 2024, 07:41:56 - Sergey: so it is possible that the insatllation rules are from pre-clang times, and cmake did not update them. but for 4.3 those install rules gor regenerated because of a brand new checkout and a build folder
Thu, Oct 3, 2024, 07:42:12 - Sergey: <@lazydodo:blender.org "other part of me is going, "wipe..."> That's what i was going to suggest :D
Thu, Oct 3, 2024, 07:42:33 - LazyDodo: should be pretty easy to track down though, install command with absolute path

Thu, Oct 3, 2024, 07:43:35 - Anthony Roberts: I don't think I ever did the WIX stuff actually, which is probably why
Thu, Oct 3, 2024, 07:44:25 - LazyDodo: we should probably not be installing test files for stuff going to the end user
Thu, Oct 3, 2024, 07:44:30 - Sergey: Anthony Roberts: we don't do WIX for dailies. its just ZIP
Thu, Oct 3, 2024, 07:45:48 - Anthony Roberts: Then never seen the issue
Thu, Oct 3, 2024, 07:46:09 - Sergey: argh, why do we have multiple 4.4 builds https://builder.blender.org/download/daily/
Thu, Oct 3, 2024, 07:46:33 - LazyDodo: I also saw a few .lib files in a recent buildbot .zip, it's on my "irked" radar, but have not gotten the time to take a closer look there
Thu, Oct 3, 2024, 07:50:41 - Sergey: something is feelign that its falling apart
Thu, Oct 3, 2024, 07:51:37 - Sergey: ah, i see what's going on with the deduplication
Thu, Oct 3, 2024, 07:52:54 - Sergey: need to update/reconfigure the master. there is some part of the config which i didn't realize actually affect the server side
Thu, Oct 3, 2024, 07:55:20 - Sergey: Anthony Roberts: would it be hard for you to try cpack on your setup? The buildbot uses `cpack -G ZIP --trace-expand -C release -B C:\Users\blender\git\blender-v430\build_package -P blender-4.3.0-beta+v43.d2a802d3c665-windows.arm64-release`
Thu, Oct 3, 2024, 08:00:17 - Anthony Roberts: I can certainly try - does it need to be an absolutely fresh build of that branch or will one a few days old also exhibit the issue?
Thu, Oct 3, 2024, 08:01:54 - Sergey: as long as the build folder is created with the clang-cl (an not switched from msvc to clang-cl somewhere mid its eixstence) would give us extra info
Thu, Oct 3, 2024, 08:03:38 - Anthony Roberts: Yeah I haven't used MSVC for over a month now üòÑ will give it a go shortly
Thu, Oct 3, 2024, 08:07:06 - Anthony Roberts: Okay, I'm struggling to see how I adapt this for my machine I use `make.bat` on, having never used cpack
Thu, Oct 3, 2024, 08:08:32 - Sergey: `cpack -G ZIP --trace-expand -C release -B . -P blender` from the build directory
Thu, Oct 3, 2024, 08:09:55 - Anthony Roberts: Okay worked for me with that, no errors
Thu, Oct 3, 2024, 08:10:12 - Anthony Roberts: I'll try with a fresh clone of the 4.3 branch etc
Thu, Oct 3, 2024, 08:11:01 - LazyDodo: be sure to add a `builddir mah_43_test` to that make.bat invocation

Thu, Oct 3, 2024, 08:51:42 - Sergey: so weird
Thu, Oct 3, 2024, 08:54:10 - LazyDodo: should be easy to throw a debug print in and see what path is being fed to install command?
Thu, Oct 3, 2024, 08:55:17 - LazyDodo: also realistically we shouldn't be calling install for `atomic_test.exe.manifest` as it's not a file that has any business going to an end uesr
Thu, Oct 3, 2024, 08:55:22 - Sergey: Anthony Roberts: Can you try giving -B agument an absolute path?
Thu, Oct 3, 2024, 08:56:22 - Anthony Roberts: Sergey: If I give it an absolute path, it errors out with `CPack Error: CPack project version not specified`
Thu, Oct 3, 2024, 08:57:04 - Anthony Roberts: That's with the working dir not being the same as the specified absolute one
Thu, Oct 3, 2024, 09:00:43 - LazyDodo: Anthony Roberts: just to check you did enable `WITH_GTESTS` ?

Code from Brecht from 8 months ago. So must be good?
Thu, Oct 3, 2024, 09:58:54 - LazyDodo: we generally don't, also the compressor for wix is _super_ slow and single threaded, you can probably shave 5+ minutes off a build by not making the .msi

```
  // Handle /pdbstripped
  if (args.hasArg(OPT_pdbstripped))
    warn("ignoring /pdbstripped flag, it is not yet supported");
```

I _guess_ what might work is to use clang-cl as the compiler, but keep on using visual studio's link.exe for the linking? That _would_ support pdbstripped then. But also might be dragons somewhere.
Thu, Oct 3, 2024, 10:38:54 - LazyDodo: [PDBCopy](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/debugger/using-pdbcopy?redirectedfrom=MSDN) can also strip a private pdb, but that may require installing some extra stuff as it doesn't ship with the sdk

LazyDodo I, for one, _love_ that blender ships with symbols. Why? Because that way I can profile any shipped version trivially. Otherwise I'd have to build them all myself. But yeah, perhaps that is not the only way (running blender's own pdb symbol server might be another way, I guess).
Thu, Oct 3, 2024, 10:57:16 - LazyDodo: Sergey: from their older release notes "The binaries can take a while to show up since they require some manual input."

Is that due to pricing? Could also push symbols to object storage or some other raw file storage.

Thu, Oct 3, 2024, 17:28:57 - LazyDodo: but you do need have a critical mass of devs thinking it's a good thing, and have the devops availability to set it all up

There are two things we can do:

1. Just copy the `package` to windows\_arm64 Git LFS repo (probably the quickest to do, but would be annoying to maintain two copies)
2. Put the template and images to `blender.git/release/windows` (similar to how darwin does it)

Do you have any strong opinions?
Fri, Oct 4, 2024, 02:30:08 - Anthony Roberts: Either or, given it's a new setup for me either way I'm flexible - I guess Ray is the one who's opinion is the more relevant one here as it might change his workflow for x64

Fri, Oct 4, 2024, 03:13:52 - Thomas Dinges: To be clear, since we are in Beta already, I am not expecting things to land in the past. üòÇ So take your time and for 4.4 we have it clearly scheduled then
Fri, Oct 4, 2024, 03:17:55 - Anthony Roberts: Message deleted
Fri, Oct 4, 2024, 03:18:18 - Anthony Roberts: Oops, nobody saw that in the wrong window üëÄ
Fri, Oct 4, 2024, 03:28:14 - Jonas Holzman: <@thomasdinges:blender.org "I hope this does not put pressur..."> That doesn't add pressure no worries :)
Fri, Oct 4, 2024, 03:28:56 - Jonas Holzman: Also, to give a bit of background on why there was a little bit of delay on my side, I‚Äôm currently working on some macOS lib building pipeline fixes (like deps wrongly linking to system libs instead of other deps, small lib breakages on Apple Clang, etc..) which I‚Äôd like to get in before going through the update list
Fri, Oct 4, 2024, 03:29:23 - Jonas Holzman: This should all land in the coming days, although if for whatever reasons shipping the lib becomes urgent, I can apply these fixes locally and get the new libs built, but ideally I‚Äôd prefer for them to be in main for everything to be clean and clear
Fri, Oct 4, 2024, 03:29:33 - Jonas Holzman: Especially since we have a bit more time now
Fri, Oct 4, 2024, 03:30:29 - LazyDodo: Sergey: no strong objections at all, actually highly encourage it, this data bothered me for a long long time, as i couldn't just wipe the deps folder and replace it with the output of the deps builder, always had to manually put back a whole bunch of stuff
Fri, Oct 4, 2024, 03:32:21 - LazyDodo: think the last one not generated by the deps builder is the wintab folder , given how badly i have railed against both `/intern` and `/extern` i can't believe i'm suggesting this, but any objections if we move that to `/extern`? (for 4.4)
Fri, Oct 4, 2024, 03:33:27 - Anthony Roberts: Agreed on wintab, it's always been an irritation to me as it means I can't just drag and drop when I do a lib rebuild
Fri, Oct 4, 2024, 03:34:54 - Falk David: Pushing a fix for the warning releated to `grease_pencil_context_poll`.
Fri, Oct 4, 2024, 03:35:59 - Sergey: <@lazydodo:blender.org "think the last one not generated..."> we have `release/windows`
Fri, Oct 4, 2024, 03:36:29 - iss: I have merged PR and unrelated issue (only metioned in comments) was closed. I guess this is doing of blender-bot?
Fri, Oct 4, 2024, 03:36:32 - LazyDodo: Sergey: it's headers though, not bitmaps and scripts
Fri, Oct 4, 2024, 03:36:37 - Sergey: LazyDodo: ah, you mean wintab to extern ?
Fri, Oct 4, 2024, 03:36:49 - LazyDodo: yes
Fri, Oct 4, 2024, 03:36:57 - Sergey: i'm fine with that
Fri, Oct 4, 2024, 03:37:05 - LazyDodo: wix+bitmaps are fine in release/windows
Fri, Oct 4, 2024, 03:37:29 - LazyDodo: also gives pablo a single place to update the installer images
Fri, Oct 4, 2024, 03:37:50 - Sergey: for the wix+bitmaps, is it something you can do, or you'd appreciate help with that?
Fri, Oct 4, 2024, 03:38:39 - LazyDodo: unsure if big bitmaps are allowed in the main repo now as it was the main reason this stuff is in ~~SVN~~ git-lfs
Fri, Oct 4, 2024, 03:39:31 - Sergey: the bitmap is smaller than splashcreen, and is updated much less often than the splash
Fri, Oct 4, 2024, 03:39:54 - LazyDodo: either way I can do it, may not be today though
Fri, Oct 4, 2024, 03:40:02 - Sergey: and git will compress it anyway. so i don't see huge issue
Fri, Oct 4, 2024, 03:40:50 - Sergey: LazyDodo: Oki. And if i'll have time to help i'll let you know
Fri, Oct 4, 2024, 03:42:03 - LazyDodo: 4:30am here, imma see if i can catch another hour of sleep, back in a bit!
Fri, Oct 4, 2024, 03:42:48 - Sergey: slaap lekker!
Fri, Oct 4, 2024, 05:36:23 - povmaniac: Good afternon..
Fri, Oct 4, 2024, 05:48:54 - Sergey: LazyDodoAnthony Roberts I had a bit of time, so... here is a patch for WIX https://projects.blender.org/blender/blender/pulls/128588
Fri, Oct 4, 2024, 05:55:18 - Anthony Roberts: Sergey: What do I need to feed to cpack to get it to do the wix thing, to test that?
Fri, Oct 4, 2024, 05:55:58 - Sergey: cpack -G WIX, but you also need to have WIX toolset installed
Fri, Oct 4, 2024, 05:56:13 - Sergey: and, probably, avialble in a PATH
Fri, Oct 4, 2024, 05:56:55 - Sergey: https://wixtoolset.org/
Fri, Oct 4, 2024, 05:57:05 - Anthony Roberts: Which version?
Fri, Oct 4, 2024, 05:57:17 - Anthony Roberts: We added support, but only in 4.0 IIRC üòÑ
Fri, Oct 4, 2024, 05:58:19 - Sergey: buildbot uses 3.11.2
but i am not sure if that is important
Fri, Oct 4, 2024, 05:59:13 - Anthony Roberts: I think it might be, to get things like the Program Files folder name right?
Fri, Oct 4, 2024, 05:59:39 - Sergey: no idea, you tell me :)
Fri, Oct 4, 2024, 05:59:58 - Sergey: but need to go to a meeting, ttyl
Fri, Oct 4, 2024, 06:01:23 - Anthony Roberts: I'll ask the guy who did the port üòÑ
Fri, Oct 4, 2024, 06:02:21 - LazyDodo: think wix 3 <-> 4 aren't compatible?
Fri, Oct 4, 2024, 06:04:37 - Anthony Roberts: Yeah, I think wix 4 changed a load of stuff about how the toolsets worked etc, but I'm not sure how much cpack abstracts all that away
Fri, Oct 4, 2024, 06:05:26 - Alaska: The triaging module has a feature request, who would be the best people to contact regarding discussion about it? Is there a preferred room/channel I should shift this too?
Feature request: On Windows and Linux (and maybe macOS), add a pop up that appears after Blender crashes to let the user know Blender has crashed, and other useful information related to it (Primarily: The crash log, or where to find it. And how/where to make a bug report).
Fri, Oct 4, 2024, 06:06:11 - LazyDodo: Anthony Roberts: https://gitlab.kitware.com/cmake/cmake/-/issues/23910
Fri, Oct 4, 2024, 06:06:29 - LazyDodo: looks like there is support, but you may need to bump cmake to "something new"
Fri, Oct 4, 2024, 06:10:54 - LazyDodo: Alaska: no technical objections, easy to add as long as it's a "simple" popup (ie no interactivity) having some mixed feelings though as the reason my previous work in this area to have better crash reporting was rejected over concerns of "too many reports"  
Fri, Oct 4, 2024, 06:12:20 - LazyDodo: i recently had another go at suggesting having better crash reporting, again got luke warm responses, including the triage module
Fri, Oct 4, 2024, 06:12:29 - LazyDodo: we clearly do not care, why bother?
Fri, Oct 4, 2024, 06:13:06 - Alaska: Was this the automatically file a report whenever a crash occurs thing? Or something else?
Fri, Oct 4, 2024, 06:13:15 - LazyDodo: yes
Fri, Oct 4, 2024, 06:13:30 - LazyDodo: it's essentially what this is, but with more steps
Fri, Oct 4, 2024, 06:14:39 - LazyDodo: also with the linux crash reports being in the state they are in, (ie no symbols) the value added for doing this on linux is on the limited side
Fri, Oct 4, 2024, 06:15:41 - LazyDodo: but again, easy on windows if you want to do it, certainly won't stand in your way
Fri, Oct 4, 2024, 06:15:59 - LazyDodo: just a heads up, it'll be a uphill battle filled with apathy 
Fri, Oct 4, 2024, 06:16:30 - Alaska: I could be wrong here, but I believe automatic crash reporting got a "meh" response from the traiging module because it can be hard to reproduce the issue from a crash log alone. So we want users to provide the steps to reproduce. So by prompting users to make their own bug report after a crash, we encourage them to provide the steps.

Unless I was misunderstanding what the automatic crash reporting system was.
Fri, Oct 4, 2024, 06:19:12 - LazyDodo: if you want a quick proof of concept, you can just chuck a quick MessageBox into `sig_handle_crash_backtrace`
Fri, Oct 4, 2024, 06:19:40 - LazyDodo: it's in `source\creator\creator_signals.cc`
Fri, Oct 4, 2024, 06:20:21 - LazyDodo: actually make that `sig_handle_crash` as it knows the filename of the crash dump
Fri, Oct 4, 2024, 06:24:32 - Alaska: Just so things are clear, here is the current state of the idea:
1. Is it feasible? Seems like it's quite easy on Windows.
2. Do we want it? Triaging team seems to think so. But we will probably want to check with others. Should I create a task to discuss it?
3. Who will implement it? The triaging team were unsure how to implement this, so the immediate thought was "someone else". But with those hints one of us can probably give it a go.
Fri, Oct 4, 2024, 06:25:23 - LazyDodo: 1. yes
2. not my call
3. If there is a design, happy to do the work for windows
Fri, Oct 4, 2024, 06:43:46 - iss: I think, that the goal is to decrease friction of getting these logs from their location into our tracker. 
I have no issue with asking for logs manually. But the problem is that I have to explain how to get these. So ideally, there would be button to show the log. Not sure if message box with path would be that helpful.
Fri, Oct 4, 2024, 06:45:52 - Alaska: A simple `Help -> Show Logs` inside Blender could do this for us as well.
That's one of the things we probably need to discuss. What is the intended usecase for this feature? Encourage users to make bug reports after a crash?Inform them of where the crash log is?
Fri, Oct 4, 2024, 06:46:26 - Alaska: I was under the impression it would be both.
Fri, Oct 4, 2024, 06:47:15 - iss: For windows, it's not that bad to give instructions "press win+R and type %TEMP%/blend_name.crash.txt", but there will be users, that will literally copy paste that and respond, that file blend_name.crash.txt exist...
Fri, Oct 4, 2024, 06:48:36 - iss: Usually I use .blend filename from report and 95% it works, but still.
Fri, Oct 4, 2024, 06:49:30 - LazyDodo: didn't Jesse Y change the location of the crash log recently? so it's in the same folder as the rest of the debug logs? 
Fri, Oct 4, 2024, 06:49:50 - Alaska: I believe that's only if you're running Blender from the `debug.cmd` files
Fri, Oct 4, 2024, 06:51:30 - iss: Alaska: Sure, it's good if we motivate user to report a bug, but I would see it as side effect. My goal as triager would be to eliminate need of explaining how to get crash log when I request one.
Fri, Oct 4, 2024, 06:53:04 - LazyDodo: I'd have to check, but i _think_ on windows we _could_ open up explorer, with the crashlog selected as active file
Fri, Oct 4, 2024, 06:53:46 - iss: If only blender could pretend to not care about some null dereference or use after free and explain that stuff went wrong and how to report it with system info and such :D
Fri, Oct 4, 2024, 06:55:04 - LazyDodo: move to a different architecture, null derefs don't _have_ to crash, it's a choice by the OS makers, i work on embedded stuff a lot, dereffing null just gets you the interrupt table most of the time üôÇ 
Fri, Oct 4, 2024, 06:55:36 - Alaska: There still seems to be a bit to discuss. I'll open a design task for it. Probably sometime tomorrow.
Fri, Oct 4, 2024, 06:55:47 - LazyDodo: makes interesting different bugs though üôÇ 
Fri, Oct 4, 2024, 06:56:56 - iss: I once tried to initialize global class with constructor in arduino, it didn't boot up after that, so stakes could be high :)
Fri, Oct 4, 2024, 06:58:07 - LazyDodo: C++ with 8-16kb of ram isn't the sanest of ideas, given how easy it is to make implicit copies
Fri, Oct 4, 2024, 06:59:13 - Sergey: Anthony RobertsLazyDodo So until we go wix 4 we're screwed on WoA? And it i's not a trivial port, so we're screwed anyway?
Fri, Oct 4, 2024, 06:59:45 - iss: <@lazydodo:blender.org "C++ with 8-16kb of ram isn't the..."> You mean ROM? It has 2K RAM (still huge)
Fri, Oct 4, 2024, 07:00:04 - LazyDodo: Sergey: yes, i don't know, never looked, how this works, never touched it, this wix stuff was there when i took over from martijn, and i've touched it once i think for a minor guid change
Fri, Oct 4, 2024, 07:00:11 - Anthony Roberts: Sergey: I'm checking with the guy who did the port, I have no idea if it will work or be broken
Fri, Oct 4, 2024, 07:00:56 - Sergey: issLazyDodo I've used c++ on pic18f2550 with 2k ram. Not a huge problem
Fri, Oct 4, 2024, 07:01:46 - Anthony Roberts: Realistically, how difficult is the port? Is it something I could do if I sunk a week of time into it? (bearing in mind I have no wix experience)
Fri, Oct 4, 2024, 07:01:50 - LazyDodo: Sergey: sure it can be done, the arduino framework is proof of that, you have to be reaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaal aware of the limitations and if you just roll in "imma do some c++, #include <vector>" you're about to have a "very bad time"
Fri, Oct 4, 2024, 07:02:30 - Sergey: `#include <iostream>` is more fun than `<vector>` :)
Fri, Oct 4, 2024, 07:03:53 - LazyDodo: semihosting may actually save your butt there, and it'll magically "just work" depending on your toolchain vendor, running out of ram due to a gazillion copies, nothing will save you
Fri, Oct 4, 2024, 07:06:23 - Sergey: it's not even ram, its rom. with all those locales and other crap you can't really yank out of stl
Fri, Oct 4, 2024, 07:06:56 - Sergey: <@anthony-roberts:blender.org "Realistically, how difficult is ..."> It can't be THAT much code to redo right? Is just NEXT GPL NEXT NEXT INSTALL. Hopefully, doable within a couple of days?
Fri, Oct 4, 2024, 07:08:48 - Sergey: Dear Chat GPT. Please convert this WIX 3 XML to WIX 5 XML :)
Fri, Oct 4, 2024, 07:09:10 - LazyDodo: i have no clue, i'd have to look at the migration guide, biggest issue working on this is the compressor in wix (atleast in 3) is single threaded and you'll just be staring at the console for up to 10 mins, so while it's not a hard job, it's one with .. uhh.. a lot of coffee breaks?
Fri, Oct 4, 2024, 07:09:13 - Anthony Roberts: Yeah I didn't want to curse it with "It's a 66 line XML file, how hard can it be", but most of it looks fairly boilerplate
Fri, Oct 4, 2024, 07:10:31 - Anthony Roberts: But... it could be possible we don't need to upgrade, I'm looking at it now
Fri, Oct 4, 2024, 07:11:05 - Josh joined the room
Fri, Oct 4, 2024, 07:11:56 - jbelanich changed their display name to Josh
Fri, Oct 4, 2024, 07:40:58 - Anthony Roberts: Sergey: Success! It builds and installs into the correct location with WiX 3
Fri, Oct 4, 2024, 07:41:17 - Sergey: Anthony Roberts: ah, so we don't need to do anything special!
Fri, Oct 4, 2024, 07:41:42 - Anthony Roberts: Apparently not, I just checked and it seems to work fine with your PR
Fri, Oct 4, 2024, 07:42:25 - Sergey: so, we land that PR, and are good to go? :)
Fri, Oct 4, 2024, 07:42:54 - Sergey: i've tried using WIX 5, and ... it would need some work. Don't feel like doing it now
Fri, Oct 4, 2024, 07:43:01 - LazyDodo: Sergey: depends if you want to give Pablo Vazquez an opportunity to update the bitmaps or not
Fri, Oct 4, 2024, 07:43:37 - Anthony Roberts: I think so? Other than pretty much all the GPU tests failing due to not loading textures in for some reason, but I think Jeroen was going to look at that
Fri, Oct 4, 2024, 07:44:02 - Anthony Roberts: (on eevee, cycles is fine)
Fri, Oct 4, 2024, 07:44:40 - Sergey: LazyDodo: Hrm. Sounds like opposite of a small incremental steps, but if it could happen soon, then whynot
Fri, Oct 4, 2024, 07:45:22 - Sergey: Pablo Vazquez: The https://projects.blender.org/blender/blender/pulls/128588 is your chance to update the images
Fri, Oct 4, 2024, 07:45:37 - LazyDodo: i'm cool either way, just figured if he _wants_ to mess with them, before they go into the main repo be a good time
Fri, Oct 4, 2024, 07:46:03 - Sergey: Pablo Vazquez: Would be good if it happens soon. We need to get that PR landed

Fri, Oct 4, 2024, 08:00:11 - Sergey: It was trolling me yesterday a lot. Especially since some other logic (the one where PYTHON is deducted) prefers to use x64 libraries
Fri, Oct 4, 2024, 08:01:15 - LazyDodo: i don't want to shame the arm maintainer, but ..... Anthony Roberts SHAME!!! SHAME!! üôÇ 
Fri, Oct 4, 2024, 08:02:13 - Anthony Roberts: Sorry, in my defence it worked on my machine üòÑ that's the trouble with machines that can run multiple arch binaries
Fri, Oct 4, 2024, 08:02:21 - Anthony Roberts: (And the CI machines!)
Fri, Oct 4, 2024, 08:02:29 - LazyDodo: works for me?

Fri, Oct 4, 2024, 08:04:09 - Sergey: I had no choice! :P
Fri, Oct 4, 2024, 08:04:32 - Anthony Roberts: I suspect it's because I always add "2022 arm64" to my make.bat out of habit
Fri, Oct 4, 2024, 08:05:11 - Sergey: yes. because you're smart. i just did `make update` to get libs and such. as i do it on any other machines...
Fri, Oct 4, 2024, 08:06:06 - LazyDodo: yeah i think we may have had different goals while working on make.bat, my objective has always been, how do i get the least ammount of hassle, Anthony Roberts 's was "how do i get this to work"
Fri, Oct 4, 2024, 08:07:16 - LazyDodo: i'd like to say make.bat is what it is due to a brilliant plan from the start, in reality it's 10 years of , what? this agian, that's enough.. i'm adding a check
Fri, Oct 4, 2024, 08:09:16 - Anthony Roberts: Yeah it was pretty much that, very much a case of "it works with at least some config? ship it" for the initial patch
Fri, Oct 4, 2024, 08:09:27 - Anthony Roberts: Hence the 6 month delay on OpenPGL support
Fri, Oct 4, 2024, 10:39:38 - LazyDodo: Bastien Montagne: doing validation builds for the 4.3 lib update, i'm on a debug (actual debug, not release+asserts) build on windows and i'm getting a whole ton of these guys `BLI_assert failed: K:\BlenderGit\blender\source\blender\blenkernel\intern\library.cc:312, BKE_library_main_rebuild_hierarchy(), at 'lib_iter->runtime.temp_index == 0'` essentially all `blendfile_*` tests are failing, when you have time can you see if you can validate this on your end?
Fri, Oct 4, 2024, 10:40:45 - Jesse Y: https://projects.blender.org/blender/blender/issues/128420
Fri, Oct 4, 2024, 10:43:55 - LazyDodo: Jesse Y: got a usd one as well, but still have to see if that's my fault or not
Fri, Oct 4, 2024, 10:44:42 - Jesse Y: what did it look like?
Fri, Oct 4, 2024, 10:44:51 - LazyDodo: USD.log (Media omitted)
Fri, Oct 4, 2024, 10:47:18 - LazyDodo: alembic is also failing, but that's due to the same assert as in the blendfile_ ones, so you're off the hook there
Fri, Oct 4, 2024, 10:47:46 - Jesse Y: That's very strange. That test coverage was added at the same time as the fix for thing that needed fixing.
Fri, Oct 4, 2024, 10:48:23 - LazyDodo: think this was on 4.3 from yesterday, just pulled and rebuilding, just in case things got fixed

Fri, Oct 4, 2024, 13:38:17 - Antonio Vazquez: ok, so I know is a general problem, not only me ;-)
Fri, Oct 4, 2024, 13:38:39 - LazyDodo: from my limited testing 4.3 seems ok, but main is broken
Fri, Oct 4, 2024, 13:38:54 - LazyDodo: so if you need to get something done, hop over to 4.3
Fri, Oct 4, 2024, 13:39:38 - Antonio Vazquez: BTW, have you tested add-on in symbolic folders? I have problems with taht, in 4.2 works perfect but in 4.3 and 4.4 the symbolic folder is not reconized by the add-ons screen
Fri, Oct 4, 2024, 13:40:07 - LazyDodo: i'm not sure what that means
Fri, Oct 4, 2024, 13:41:39 - Antonio Vazquez: instead to put the folder of the add-on in `C:\Users\MiUser\AppData\Roaming\Blender Foundation\Blender\4.3\scripts\addons`  I have created a symbolic linked folder (`mklink`) with the add-on
Fri, Oct 4, 2024, 13:42:16 - Antonio Vazquez: Message deleted
Fri, Oct 4, 2024, 13:42:25 - LazyDodo: 4.3 had this whole transition to extensions, unsure about the exact details, i'd check the release notes to see if it mentions any changes in that area
Fri, Oct 4, 2024, 13:43:03 - Jesse Y: I use symbolic links too and it still works for my "regular" addon.  Weird...
Fri, Oct 4, 2024, 13:43:05 - Antonio Vazquez: the problem is the folders created with mklink are not displayed in add-ons install screen
Fri, Oct 4, 2024, 13:44:11 - Antonio Vazquez: Jesse Y: I used `mklink \j`
Fri, Oct 4, 2024, 13:45:22 - Jesse Y: right, a junction is what I use as well.  I didn't use mklink though, I used the powershell equivalent, which should be the same thing...
Fri, Oct 4, 2024, 13:45:38 - Antonio Vazquez: can you give me the command to test?
Fri, Oct 4, 2024, 13:49:02 - Jesse Y: ```
cd "C:\Users\jesse\AppData\Roaming\Blender Foundation\Blender\4.4\scripts\addons"
New-Item -Type "Junction" -Target C:\Users\jesse\source\dconfig\ -Path dconfig/
```
Fri, Oct 4, 2024, 13:49:54 - Antonio Vazquez: Jesse Y:  I have found the problem
Fri, Oct 4, 2024, 13:50:53 - Antonio Vazquez: the problem was I have added a new HD last week and the unit name changed since I did the link üòú
Fri, Oct 4, 2024, 13:51:04 - LazyDodo: that'll do it üòâ 
Fri, Oct 4, 2024, 13:58:18 - LazyDodo: i ran out of time to come up with a fix, i don't know what to revert with all the merge commits in between, main is gonna be borked until the GPU guys take a look sadly 
Fri, Oct 4, 2024, 13:58:56 - LazyDodo: i do not envy the tracker guys this weekend
Fri, Oct 4, 2024, 14:00:28 - Jesse Y: I think I can purposely turf the daily builds if necessary
Fri, Oct 4, 2024, 14:01:03 - LazyDodo: see if you can get Sergey  or Thomas Dinges  to respond
Fri, Oct 4, 2024, 14:01:06 - LazyDodo: but i'll be honest
Fri, Oct 4, 2024, 14:01:21 - LazyDodo: i'm not hating the idea of just adding bad compile commit
Fri, Oct 4, 2024, 14:01:48 - LazyDodo: i do have to head out now, sooo... tag...you're it.. (and i'm sorry)
Fri, Oct 4, 2024, 14:04:43 - Thomas Dinges: What's wrong? 
Fri, Oct 4, 2024, 14:08:27 - Antonio Vazquez: Thomas Dinges: a GPU error as soon you start main version
Fri, Oct 4, 2024, 14:08:38 - Antonio Vazquez: there are some compiler error in the shaders
Fri, Oct 4, 2024, 14:11:31 - Thomas Dinges: Cl√©ment Foucault: Bon nuit! Are you still here? üòÉ
Fri, Oct 4, 2024, 14:12:20 - Tomasz Bator joined the room

Fri, Oct 4, 2024, 14:14:45 - Thomas Dinges: Pardon! ü•≤ Can you please check on that shader error or just revert it until Monday?
Fri, Oct 4, 2024, 14:14:58 - Cl√©ment Foucault: I'm compiling. Apparently it is a last minute change that I thought was very well thought through and inocuous is wreaking havok.
Fri, Oct 4, 2024, 14:18:17 - Iliya Katushenock: `git revert -n e4c802e53ec07d90274abfd76ceab3334ca6283c` at least resolve the crash, but there is still a lot of errors
Fri, Oct 4, 2024, 14:22:39 - Harley Acheson: Not having any luck with 4.3 either
Fri, Oct 4, 2024, 14:23:30 - Tomasz Bator set a profile picture
Fri, Oct 4, 2024, 14:24:16 - tomba4 changed their display name to Tomasz Bator
Fri, Oct 4, 2024, 14:26:43 - Cl√©ment Foucault: If 4.3 is broken, then it is not my changes
Fri, Oct 4, 2024, 14:28:15 - Iliya Katushenock: `e4c802e53ec07d90274abfd76ceab3334ca6283c` - make it crash, something other make it just too noise with

I was talking about this
Fri, Oct 4, 2024, 14:33:50 - Cl√©ment Foucault: Also. I just pushed the fix. Stupid copy paste error.
Fri, Oct 4, 2024, 14:36:18 - Thomas Dinges: Thanks üôè
Fri, Oct 4, 2024, 14:38:11 - Cl√©ment Foucault: Can anyone confirm?

Fri, Oct 4, 2024, 14:54:17 - Iliya Katushenock: I still can see a lot of shader errors
Fri, Oct 4, 2024, 14:57:36 - Cl√©ment Foucault: Iliya Katushenock: hmm you are right. Checking again
Fri, Oct 4, 2024, 15:07:54 - weizhen: Miguel Pozo: green right before merge commits are from the 4.3 branch and they pass in 4.3. If merge commits fail then main fail
Fri, Oct 4, 2024, 15:12:31 - Cl√©ment Foucault: Miguel Pozo: reverting your commits fixes the issues. It complains about double definitions of many symbols.

Fri, Oct 4, 2024, 15:13:20 - LazyDodo: Miguel Pozo: think mac was the only bot to catch the issue, cause win/lin don't run the shader stuff
Fri, Oct 4, 2024, 15:15:12 - Cl√©ment Foucault: @LazyDodo There is that. But Miguel's patch is **not** making the test fail. It only creates error when launching blender.
Fri, Oct 4, 2024, 15:18:58 - LazyDodo: I'm not sure what you mean? The error the bot saw was more or less the same as i had when starting locally

If you're sure that's the cause feel free to revert.

Fri, Oct 4, 2024, 16:27:04 - Jesse Y: 5 mins to spare too... ok, so only the "normal" amount of bugs will come in tonight
Fri, Oct 4, 2024, 17:45:58 - vmenons: <@alaska:blender.org "vmenons This is a developer chan..."> got it thanks
Fri, Oct 4, 2024, 17:46:36 - vmenons: I asked because I'd shared my question in the dev forum yesterday and learned that wasn't the right place haha
Fri, Oct 4, 2024, 17:48:50 - vmenons: I recently observed blender's global scaling works differently than expected. If an object is rotated in a non 90degree angle in object mode and if we try to scale it along a single axis in global space, without the transforms applied, it seems to not be able to do it. I checked other software, Maya, Houdini and Zbrush and they are all able to scale along a single axis in the global space as expected. So I've been trying to understand what limits Blender from doing so.
Fri, Oct 4, 2024, 17:49:10 - vmenons: Blender_Scale_Vid.mp4 (Media omitted)
Fri, Oct 4, 2024, 17:49:43 - vmenons: Here's a video explaining what I mean. I'd love to understand what's the process behind it, if anyone knows. I've rotated a plane 45 degrees and haven't applied any transforms in any software :)
Fri, Oct 4, 2024, 17:55:31 - Iliya Katushenock: vmenons: In blender, scale is the object property, you still able to achieve the same effect in case you will scale the mesh elements itself.
Fri, Oct 4, 2024, 17:57:24 - vmenons: <@mod:blender.org "vmenons: In blender, scale is th..."> by mesh elements do you mean the mesh's components in edit mode?
Fri, Oct 4, 2024, 17:57:33 - Iliya Katushenock: correct
Fri, Oct 4, 2024, 17:58:06 - vmenons: ah yes that I understand. It's the scaling in object mode that has me intrigued as to why the global space works differently.
Fri, Oct 4, 2024, 17:59:06 - vmenons: I'm in object mode in maya and in the object level in houdini as well but the global scaling there seems to work more globally, i.e., not related to the object's space rotation values
Fri, Oct 4, 2024, 18:00:34 - vmenons: I was surprised when I saw this actually. I went all the way back to blender 2.6, which was the first version of blender I used and was really intrigued when I saw it worked the same way haha
Fri, Oct 4, 2024, 18:00:42 - Iliya Katushenock: And you probably not able to change `x`/`y`/`z` scale components as in blender, since such transformations requires shift of the matrix rows
Fri, Oct 4, 2024, 18:02:14 - sensarice: Message deleted
Fri, Oct 4, 2024, 18:04:13 - Iliya Katushenock: Simplest way to answer all this questions: [Essence of linear algebra](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNk_zzaMoSs&list=PLZHQObOWTQDPD3MizzM2xVFitgF8hE_ab)
Fri, Oct 4, 2024, 18:12:41 - sensarice: Regarding the geometry structure in Blender, are there any diagrammatic explanations? It's relatively difficult to understand by jumping around in the source code.
Fri, Oct 4, 2024, 18:14:24 - vmenons: <@mod:blender.org "And you probably not able to cha..."> hmmm I kinda understand what you mean
Fri, Oct 4, 2024, 18:14:34 - Iliya Katushenock: sensarice: which one geometry?
Fri, Oct 4, 2024, 18:15:23 - vmenons: So I assume it's just a different way that blender calculates scaling compared to other tools, that looks like a limitation?
Fri, Oct 4, 2024, 18:15:45 - Iliya Katushenock: This is not limitation if you know math
Fri, Oct 4, 2024, 18:15:57 - vmenons: Yeah that I understand haha
Fri, Oct 4, 2024, 18:17:53 - sensarice: For example, an object can simultaneously have points, meshes, curves, and volumes, and a mesh itself consists of vertices, edges, and faces. I believe that for such structural designs, there should be an illustrative diagram to aid understanding, along with an explanation of which part of the source code this corresponds to.
Fri, Oct 4, 2024, 18:18:23 - vmenons: But as an artist juggling between tools it felt like one when I first noticed it haha. Which is why I wanted to look into this more. Unreal Engine for instance, doesn't even let you scale globally for one. But it makes sense in a way
Fri, Oct 4, 2024, 18:19:05 - sensarice: A few days ago, I was studying Blender's DNA, and now I'm researching the bke.
Fri, Oct 4, 2024, 18:23:01 - Iliya Katushenock: https://developer.blender.org/docs/features/
Fri, Oct 4, 2024, 18:27:24 - sensarice: Since the introduction of geometry nodes, I believe objects should be called geometry objects rather than mesh objects, and the necessity for conversion between them should only be related to import and export,
Fri, Oct 4, 2024, 18:42:46 - sensarice: In common commercial projects, to quickly add a feature to the software, it's often acceptable to include any code that might not be used in order to save development time. However, this mindset is the biggest obstacle on the path to becoming a Blender code contributor.
Fri, Oct 4, 2024, 18:51:23 - sensarice: 
I encountered more issues than I expected when researching the import of model textures, such as how Blender should link to textures that are included within the model file.

Blender - Platform Unsupported

Your graphics card or macOS version is not supported

Upgrading to the latest macOS version may improve Blender support

The program will now close.

Blender quit -- this runs perfectly fine on Linux partition of the same machine, can anyone tell me why please?
Sat, Oct 5, 2024, 01:53:58 - Alaska: hoanguk there isn't enough information to go off of as you haven't told us what graphics card you're using. But the most likely explaination is that your graphics card + driver combination on macOS doesn't support all the features required by Blender. While the graphics card + driver combination on Linux is supported.
Like the message said, updating macOS (which updates the graphics drivers) may help you here.

On a side note: This is a channel for developers. This isn't really the best place to ask these questions, although I'm not sure which site to direct you towards. And posting long messages isn't well suited to this type of site.
Sat, Oct 5, 2024, 01:58:28 - xan2622: hoanguk Alaska:  This forum is better suited for Blender support / Blender usage questions: https://blenderartists.org/c/support/9/l/new
Sat, Oct 5, 2024, 02:03:57 - xan2622: I tend to think that new members who join this Element/Matrix server should spawn in https://matrix.to/#/#blender-ask-and-answer:blender.org 
Don't know if it's possible but this would avoid this kind of issues üëÜ (posting in the wrong channel)

Sat, Oct 5, 2024, 16:15:23 - John Kiril Swenson: Hi all, I wanted to get blender builds set up on my windows machine w/ visual studio for redundancy and in case I ever need to test for that OS (up until now i've been building on linux). 

The docs state that a Blender.sln project should be automatically generated when building blender on Windows but I'm not seeing it show up, any ideas why? I'm just running `make debug developer 2019 ninja` -- it produces the `build_windows_x64_vc16_Debug` dir just fine, but no .sln file to be found. (ive downloaded make/cmake/ninja through the scoop package manager, for reference).
Sat, Oct 5, 2024, 16:16:06 - John Kiril Swenson: not too familiar with windows ecosystem / visual studio so any help would be greatly appreciated :-) 
Sat, Oct 5, 2024, 16:29:44 - LazyDodo: John Kiril Swenson: you used the ninja generator, naturally it won't generate a VS solution, but ninja build files
Sat, Oct 5, 2024, 16:30:59 - LazyDodo: if you are not planning on using the IDE you can keep on using ninja, if it's just to see if a test fails or not, it be my preferred build system
Sat, Oct 5, 2024, 16:31:59 - LazyDodo: if you are planning on using the IDE you gotta give up ninja, as you can't switch build systems once a builddir is made, you may have to remove the build folder you have, or add a `builddir my_second_builddir` to your make.bat invocation to stick it in a different folder

Sun, Oct 6, 2024, 18:18:11 - Alaska: samkou_16: The lights probably have a large radius.
Anyway, this is a developer channel and isn't the right place to ask these sorts of questions. It's better to ask them on a community site better suited for asking for help. A list of various community sites with different purposes can be found here: https://www.blender.org/community/
Mon, Oct 7, 2024, 00:27:00 - Thomas Dinges: Good morning. May I suggest to reply inside of a thread for off-topic questions? This way there is much less disturbance. :)
Mon, Oct 7, 2024, 00:34:33 - Nika Kutsniashvili: They'll probably not see it in threads tho. There are no notifications for threads in new chat
Mon, Oct 7, 2024, 00:35:31 - Alaska: If you `@person's name` they  will be notified.
Mon, Oct 7, 2024, 00:38:46 - Nika Kutsniashvili: They will hear the sound but site will not show which room it is coming from
Mon, Oct 7, 2024, 00:39:49 - Nika Kutsniashvili: If you werent online when it rang youre on a hunt. First reply you might notice when bar appears under your comment but after that its difficult
Mon, Oct 7, 2024, 00:40:25 - Thomas Dinges: I am honestly less concerned about this but more about the disturbances for others. Again I am only talking about off-topic comments. 
Mon, Oct 7, 2024, 00:41:52 - Nika Kutsniashvili: Yeah but if they miss answer and see purpose of chat they're likely to ask again and create more off-topic :/
Mon, Oct 7, 2024, 00:43:14 - Thomas Dinges: Mods can always delete messages and send people a DM. But it was just a suggestion, one that was also off-topic so could have been replied in a thread too :P I think this shows the effect very well. Rather than 1 message and replies in a thread, everyone now has to read 5-6 messages.
Mon, Oct 7, 2024, 00:49:37 - Alaska: Here's a test to see how it works. Nika Kutsniashvili 
Mon, Oct 7, 2024, 00:51:17 - Nika Kutsniashvili: Im on a phone so I get handy notification popup :D but on PC it will be just sound
Mon, Oct 7, 2024, 00:51:55 - Wu Yiming: if you enable desktop notification in the browser, it can show a popup and when you click it will bring you to the room
Mon, Oct 7, 2024, 00:52:53 - Alaska: Can someone send a message with @Alaska and I'll see what happens on the desktop web interface.
Mon, Oct 7, 2024, 00:53:04 - Wu Yiming: Alaska: hi
Mon, Oct 7, 2024, 00:53:46 - Alaska: Oh, that is faily useless at notifying people where it came from.
Mon, Oct 7, 2024, 00:53:52 - Nika Kutsniashvili: Those ones I got nothing
Mon, Oct 7, 2024, 00:54:51 - Alaska: I think that's expected as you weren't pinged with `@`. But it is different from Rocket chat where you would get notified for everything that happened in a thread you were in.
Mon, Oct 7, 2024, 00:55:55 - Wu Yiming: I _think_ I get everything and also thread messages if I have joined them
Mon, Oct 7, 2024, 00:57:15 - Wu Yiming: ÂõæÁâá.png (Media omitted)
Mon, Oct 7, 2024, 00:57:24 - Wu Yiming: e.g. if I click this it brings me to the room and message
Mon, Oct 7, 2024, 00:57:55 - Alaska: What interface are you using to access this? The web interface or a app?
Mon, Oct 7, 2024, 00:58:04 - Wu Yiming: just web browser
Mon, Oct 7, 2024, 00:59:19 - Alaska: Must be a setting I have turned off
Mon, Oct 7, 2024, 01:00:01 - Wu Yiming: I don't know what a notification would look like under windows tho
Mon, Oct 7, 2024, 01:00:25 - Alaska: Is this the "Desktop notifications" setting?
Mon, Oct 7, 2024, 01:00:29 - Wu Yiming: firefox you can check on the left side of the URL there's a setting button and you _should_ be able to see notification thing yeah
Mon, Oct 7, 2024, 01:01:06 - Alaska: I've enabled it here on Windows. Let's see what it looks like.
Mon, Oct 7, 2024, 01:01:34 - Wu Yiming: Alaska: can you see this
Mon, Oct 7, 2024, 01:02:19 - Alaska: Yep, I can see it.
Mon, Oct 7, 2024, 01:02:29 - Wu Yiming: Ah great :D

Mon, Oct 7, 2024, 01:03:05 - Wu Yiming: üòÖ sometimes when there's a lot of message it tend to fill up side of my screen
Mon, Oct 7, 2024, 01:03:50 - Alaska: But I think this setting is off by default. And requires a user to allow the site to send notifications, so it's not that useful for the random user that ends up here and asks a random question.
Mon, Oct 7, 2024, 01:04:22 - Wu Yiming: I don't think we can control that

Mon, Oct 7, 2024, 02:49:19 - Cl√©ment Foucault: Dropping by your desk there is something fishy
Mon, Oct 7, 2024, 02:49:23 - Lukas T√∂nne: apparently the 2->1 arg change was reverted [here](https://projects.blender.org/blender/blender/commit/9d3f35a0bf1bf5776363bfd61d53a7c85b5827a4) but the `GPU_SHADER_INTERFACE_INFO` invoke in `draw_debug_info.hh` was not reverted
Mon, Oct 7, 2024, 03:07:14 - Lukas T√∂nne: fixed by removing the header from the build folder (seems some bots have the same issue). probably some kind of build folder cleanup needed after recent changes?

Mon, Oct 7, 2024, 03:37:11 - Cl√©ment Foucault: Falk David: Fix is in. But would like to avoid future issue by adding a suffix. But weirdly, that doesn't work. Maybe LazyDodo can help me trouble shooting this?
Mon, Oct 7, 2024, 04:39:36 - LazyDodo: Cl√©ment Foucault: absolutely, i'll be at the office in about an hour, we can take a look then
Mon, Oct 7, 2024, 05:04:54 - Wu Yiming: Guys, is it possible to get the "final type" of the objects (after being modified by GN) inside a `FOREACH_COLLECTION_VISIBLE_OBJECT_RECURSIVE_BEGIN` iteration?
Mon, Oct 7, 2024, 05:06:51 - Falk David: You probably want `DEG_get_evaluated_object`
Mon, Oct 7, 2024, 05:07:16 - Falk David: The evaluated state of the object will be the state after modifier evaluation
Mon, Oct 7, 2024, 05:07:52 - Wu Yiming: <@filedescriptor:blender.org "You probably want `DEG_get_evalu..."> Is it possible during `update_depsgraph`? (I want to add relation based on what final type of the object is)
Mon, Oct 7, 2024, 05:08:20 - Falk David: oh you mean `object->type` ?
Mon, Oct 7, 2024, 05:08:29 - Falk David: That doesn't change...
Mon, Oct 7, 2024, 05:08:30 - Wu Yiming: yepp
Mon, Oct 7, 2024, 05:09:12 - Falk David: the `object->type` doesn't change
Mon, Oct 7, 2024, 05:09:23 - Wu Yiming: ü´† then how can i know if there's "other types of geometry components"? (maybe not possible at that stage)
Mon, Oct 7, 2024, 05:09:50 - Falk David: For that you can check `object->runtime.geometry_set_eval` for e.g. `has_mesh()`
Mon, Oct 7, 2024, 05:10:29 - Wu Yiming: <@filedescriptor:blender.org "For that you can check `object->..."> Ahhh that might be what I'm looking for. Not sure if it has delays like... the object may not have been evaluated when `update_depsgraph()` was called
Mon, Oct 7, 2024, 05:10:31 - Falk David: The `geometry_set_eval` contains all the geometry components after evaluation
Mon, Oct 7, 2024, 05:12:22 - Falk David: `mti->update_depsgraph` is called during the evaluation of the object.
Mon, Oct 7, 2024, 05:12:33 - Falk David: See `DepsgraphRelationBuilder::build_object_modifiers`
Mon, Oct 7, 2024, 05:20:14 - Wu Yiming: Is it just me or did blender in latest main suddenly gets wildly unresponsive starting up and after dozens of seconds it resumes normal
Mon, Oct 7, 2024, 05:29:34 - Cl√©ment Foucault: Wu Yiming: might be shader compilation. I updated all of them
Mon, Oct 7, 2024, 05:30:13 - Cl√©ment Foucault: Wu Yiming: is that a big freeze on startup (gray screen)?
Mon, Oct 7, 2024, 05:31:39 - Falk David: Cl√©ment Foucault Bots are still failing üò¢ https://builder.blender.org/admin/#/builders/132/builds/7456
Mon, Oct 7, 2024, 05:32:24 - Wu Yiming: Here on my 4070/linux, grey screen is like maybe 2 seconds but afterwards it's like 30 seconds of laggy (apparently video card is running hard cause system graphics also lags), then ok
Mon, Oct 7, 2024, 05:33:01 - Cl√©ment Foucault: Then it is weird
Mon, Oct 7, 2024, 05:33:18 - Cl√©ment Foucault: Falk David: the buildbot needs to clean the build folder :'(
Mon, Oct 7, 2024, 05:33:46 - Falk David: Sergey HEELLLP
Mon, Oct 7, 2024, 05:33:48 - Cl√©ment Foucault: Sergey: Bart van der Braak who could do that?
Mon, Oct 7, 2024, 05:34:46 - Bart van der Braak: What should be done?
Mon, Oct 7, 2024, 05:35:11 - Wu Yiming: ü•≤ this time blender lagged about a minute before interface resuming normal
Mon, Oct 7, 2024, 05:35:56 - Cl√©ment Foucault: Bart van der Braak: remove one file from buildfolder of every buildbot, or nuke build folder.
Mon, Oct 7, 2024, 05:36:42 - Bart van der Braak: which file?
Mon, Oct 7, 2024, 05:36:55 - Sergey: Bart van der Braak: we have `Machine-Remove-Folder` function in `machine-invoke-workers.ps1`
Mon, Oct 7, 2024, 05:37:49 - Sergey: But the fact that build folder needs to be be cleared sounds VERY fishy to me. Almost and indicative that someone is doing wrong things in CMake
Mon, Oct 7, 2024, 05:38:17 - Cl√©ment Foucault: Well, I fuckdup
Mon, Oct 7, 2024, 05:38:31 - Sergey: Can you unfackdup?
Mon, Oct 7, 2024, 05:39:12 - Sergey: fuckdown?
Mon, Oct 7, 2024, 05:40:42 - Wu Yiming: weird, opening blender from double clicking the file doesn't seem to produce interface lag for me atm
Mon, Oct 7, 2024, 05:41:48 - LazyDodo: Cl√©ment Foucault: is this (the stale file) is the same thing i'm unfucking in the builds channel or a new thing?
Mon, Oct 7, 2024, 05:44:48 - Sergey: They are working with Bart to remove some stale file from tall the workers
Mon, Oct 7, 2024, 05:45:45 - Sergey: Bart van der Braak: don't forget we have vdev and vexp tracks, and maybe releases-specific tracks. Not sure which branches the "bad" commit from Clement has made to
Mon, Oct 7, 2024, 05:52:36 - LazyDodo: Sergey: we'd still need to root cause this, what if the stale file comes back?
Mon, Oct 7, 2024, 05:52:52 - LazyDodo: we can't have bart do this 3 times  aday
Mon, Oct 7, 2024, 05:59:31 - Cl√©ment Foucault: LazyDodo:  I removed the stale file causing issue https://projects.blender.org/blender/blender/commit/b1cbd9c8894812f5281faf78c77b7bab8ca3baed .
But yes, adding a suffix to the generated file w√∏uld avoid these kind of things to happen in the future.
Mon, Oct 7, 2024, 06:09:36 - Bart van der Braak: Cleaning up the mangled `source/blender/draw/intern/shaders/draw_debug_info.hh` file for all workers, all tracks and on the `build_asserts` as well as `build_release` build locations.
Mon, Oct 7, 2024, 06:10:06 - Cl√©ment Foucault: Thank you for unfucking
Mon, Oct 7, 2024, 06:10:39 - Bart van der Braak: Invoking the cleanup has completed üôÇ
Mon, Oct 7, 2024, 06:10:45 - Bart van der Braak: Let me know if that fixed it.
Mon, Oct 7, 2024, 06:11:14 - Cl√©ment Foucault: Falk David Lukas T√∂nne : you can try the builbot again
Mon, Oct 7, 2024, 06:11:26 - Bart van der Braak: Message deleted
Mon, Oct 7, 2024, 06:11:26 - Falk David: Triggered one just now! https://builder.blender.org/admin/#/builders/136/builds/7824
Mon, Oct 7, 2024, 06:22:01 - Bart van der Braak: hmmm
Mon, Oct 7, 2024, 06:22:17 - Bart van der Braak: ```

Mon, Oct 7, 2024, 06:22:19 - Bart van der Braak: Still fucked?
Mon, Oct 7, 2024, 06:23:50 - Wu Yiming: Cl√©ment Foucault: Hang/not hang seems to be random. I have a few starts that didn't have any problems, now it's hanging again
Mon, Oct 7, 2024, 06:25:42 - Cl√©ment Foucault: Bart van der Braak: seems like so
Mon, Oct 7, 2024, 06:25:55 - Cl√©ment Foucault: Then nuke them build folder?
Mon, Oct 7, 2024, 06:25:57 - Bart van der Braak: Let me check if my cleanup script was wrong
Mon, Oct 7, 2024, 06:30:01 - Cl√©ment Foucault: Sergey: shouldn't I tag the copy also as generated? `set_source_files_properties(${_file_tmp} PROPERTIES GENERATED TRUE)` ?
Mon, Oct 7, 2024, 06:30:19 - Bart van der Braak: This file is only found in the source folders..

Mon, Oct 7, 2024, 06:30:25 - Bart van der Braak: So my cleanup did remove it.
Mon, Oct 7, 2024, 06:30:43 - Bart van der Braak: I don't need to remove it from these too right?
Mon, Oct 7, 2024, 06:31:44 - Bart van der Braak: Ah, I found an error on my part.
Mon, Oct 7, 2024, 06:32:07 - Bart van der Braak: Running the cleanup again.
Mon, Oct 7, 2024, 06:34:27 - Lukas T√∂nne: now it can't find some stuff at all: https://builder.blender.org/admin/#/builders/132/builds/7461
Mon, Oct 7, 2024, 06:35:03 - Lukas T√∂nne: (builds and runs fine locally)
Mon, Oct 7, 2024, 06:36:54 - Falk David: Some bots are still failing: https://builder.blender.org/admin/#/builders/136/builds/7824
Mon, Oct 7, 2024, 06:41:49 - Sergey: Falk David: because the root of the cause is not resolved, so once PR against `main` compiled on a worker, PR against 4.3 will fail
Mon, Oct 7, 2024, 06:42:47 - Sergey: Can we just revert that commit, re-iterate on it, and do proper review + testing?
Mon, Oct 7, 2024, 06:45:26 - Sergey: Cl√©ment Foucault: ^^^^^^^
Mon, Oct 7, 2024, 06:46:20 - Cl√©ment Foucault: Sergey: the file was removed from the preprocess list

> I removed the stale file causing issue https://projects.blender.org/blender/blender/commit/b1cbd9c8894812f5281faf78c77b7bab8ca3baed .
Mon, Oct 7, 2024, 06:47:50 - Sergey: Cl√©ment Foucault: but then you somehow need to make everyone to merge `main` to the PRs against `main`
Mon, Oct 7, 2024, 06:48:24 - Cl√©ment Foucault: Well, that's the same thing if you revert
Mon, Oct 7, 2024, 06:48:53 - Cl√©ment Foucault: Anythin between 0bfd5e3536e2feb92b28bfcd4ce18296ba773f32 and b1cbd9c8894812f5281faf78c77b7bab8ca3baed will trigger the issue again
Mon, Oct 7, 2024, 06:48:59 - Sergey: well, sure. the point is: we do need proper solution first. if the file removal from the list solves the problem then sure
Mon, Oct 7, 2024, 06:51:14 - Cl√©ment Foucault: Current state is working. Anything we add on top is just to improve safety.
Mon, Oct 7, 2024, 06:51:27 - Sergey: "working"
Mon, Oct 7, 2024, 06:57:37 - Sergey: How about: we rename `draw_debug_info.hh` -> `draw_debug_create_info.hh` in 4.3 and merge to main
Mon, Oct 7, 2024, 06:58:40 - Sergey: This way we stop the PRs from "cross-talking", and if PR fails we ask them to merge the updated target branch
Mon, Oct 7, 2024, 06:59:12 - Cl√©ment Foucault: That sounds good!
Mon, Oct 7, 2024, 06:59:54 - Cl√©ment Foucault: I can do it
Mon, Oct 7, 2024, 07:02:55 - Sergey: Please do!
Mon, Oct 7, 2024, 07:20:34 - Cl√©ment Foucault: I just did!
Mon, Oct 7, 2024, 07:21:57 - Cl√©ment Foucault: Now, the mistery is why main did not failed to compile after the broken commit
Mon, Oct 7, 2024, 07:48:03 - Fiona Cohen: Hello, who from the remote team will be joining the conference at the end of the month?
I already know for a few people (Christoph, Hans, Jacques, Pratik, Thomas, Lukas S), what about Wu Yiming Aaron Carlisle iss Harley Acheson Miguel Pozo Sean Kim Jesse Y ?
If you can confirm your situation, either in this thread, or privately :)
Mon, Oct 7, 2024, 07:48:22 - Wu Yiming: I'm coming for bcon
Mon, Oct 7, 2024, 07:49:08 - Miguel Pozo: Not going! üôÅ
Mon, Oct 7, 2024, 07:50:05 - Harley Acheson: I‚Äôll be there for the Conference again, and extending it into a holiday, so away the two weeks afterward.
Mon, Oct 7, 2024, 07:55:34 - Thomas Dinges: Second kick-off in 5 minutes üîî
Mon, Oct 7, 2024, 07:58:27 - Jesse Y: I'm not going to make it this year.
Mon, Oct 7, 2024, 07:58:31 - Sean Kim: Won't be there this time unfortunately, next year though!
Mon, Oct 7, 2024, 08:02:50 - Bart van der Braak: FYI:
**DevTalk will be undergoing a migration at 18.00 CEST. It will be set to read-only mode from that until the migration is finished. Short periods of downtime may occur.**

EDIT: Done ‚úÖÔ∏è
Mon, Oct 7, 2024, 08:16:54 - Fiona Cohen: hopefully next year yes!
Mon, Oct 7, 2024, 09:09:51 - HowardTrickey: Me, remote volunteer
Mon, Oct 7, 2024, 10:09:52 - Aras Pranckeviƒçius: HowardTrickey you & me are probably not part of the official team, aren't we :) Anyway, see you there!
Mon, Oct 7, 2024, 10:40:18 - Jesse Y: Those GPU shader compiler errors on the bots mentioned earlier, so we need to do another build if they pop up?
Mon, Oct 7, 2024, 10:40:59 - Falk David: are you on latest blender 4.3 release branch ?
Mon, Oct 7, 2024, 10:41:44 - Jesse Y: Trying to get an external contributors PR built (they updated yesterday) - targetting 4.3 branch
Mon, Oct 7, 2024, 10:42:00 - Falk David: Ah then you might want to merge with the release branch again
Mon, Oct 7, 2024, 10:42:58 - Falk David: Otherwise you can try removing the `gpu_shader_info.hh` file in your build folder

Mon, Oct 7, 2024, 10:43:23 - Jesse Y: This is on the bots
Mon, Oct 7, 2024, 10:43:43 - Falk David: oh! Then merging with the latest release branch and kicking them again should fix it
Mon, Oct 7, 2024, 10:44:03 - Jesse Y: alright ,so I'll need to manually update their branch sounds like
Mon, Oct 7, 2024, 10:44:28 - Falk David: Can you push to other peoples branches?
Mon, Oct 7, 2024, 10:44:50 - Jesse Y: usually, yes.  
Mon, Oct 7, 2024, 10:45:21 - Falk David: then I'd just merge with `blender-v4.3-release` locally and push to their branch
Mon, Oct 7, 2024, 10:46:05 - LazyDodo: Falk David: think it's on the handbook somewhere, but i kept this note `git push git@projects.blender.org:TheirUserName/blender.git your-local-branch:their-remote-branch`

Mon, Oct 7, 2024, 10:50:01 - Jesse Y: sigh, yeah, I try not to do it since it's kinda annoying to get username and their branch name
Mon, Oct 7, 2024, 10:51:23 - LazyDodo: it's right there at the top of every PR?
Mon, Oct 7, 2024, 10:51:59 - LazyDodo: `xxxx  wants to merge 4 commits from their_user_name/blender:their-branch-name`
Mon, Oct 7, 2024, 10:51:59 - Jesse Y: not in the format seemingly required by the initial pull of their PR into my local tree
Mon, Oct 7, 2024, 10:52:30 - Jesse Y: or in the format that i can directly copy paste into the push
Mon, Oct 7, 2024, 10:52:42 - LazyDodo: yeah no, you have to fiddle a bit
Mon, Oct 7, 2024, 10:53:51 - LazyDodo: for getting pr i have a nifty batch file `getpr.cmd`
Mon, Oct 7, 2024, 10:53:57 - LazyDodo: ```plaintext
git fetch origin pull/%1/head:pr%1%2
git checkout pr%1%2
```
Mon, Oct 7, 2024, 10:54:37 - LazyDodo: can i can just call `getpr 12345` or `getpr 12345 _second_try` as it doesn't like it if the branch already exists
Mon, Oct 7, 2024, 10:55:09 - LazyDodo: not quite as nice as arc, but i'll do for now
Mon, Oct 7, 2024, 11:00:30 - Jesse Y: yeah, i like to use their same branch name locally so would be cool to figure out a way to automatically pull that

Mon, Oct 7, 2024, 23:22:00 - Falk David: No if it can go into 4.3 then it should be based on 4.3 and merged into there first. Then merge the release branch into main.

Tue, Oct 8, 2024, 02:48:34 - Thomas Dinges: A code cleanup commit should not go into 4.3 at this point
Tue, Oct 8, 2024, 02:48:41 - Thomas Dinges: 4.3 only receives bug fixes
Tue, Oct 8, 2024, 03:13:23 - Jeroen Bakker: Landing code cleanups only in main, would add more time and effort to merge blender 4.3 into 4.4.
Tue, Oct 8, 2024, 03:14:27 - Thomas Dinges: I am sorry, but since when does code cleanup qualify as a bugfix? 
Tue, Oct 8, 2024, 03:14:29 - Jeroen Bakker: "Focus on bug fixing and getting the release ready"
Tue, Oct 8, 2024, 03:14:56 - Thomas Dinges: The docs clearly say `Bug fixing only`
Tue, Oct 8, 2024, 03:16:06 - Jeroen Bakker: Think there is some confusion between the image and the table...
Tue, Oct 8, 2024, 03:16:30 - Thomas Dinges sent an image. (Media omitted)
Tue, Oct 8, 2024, 03:16:36 - Thomas Dinges: The table says the same
Tue, Oct 8, 2024, 03:16:44 - Jeroen Bakker: Focus != only
Tue, Oct 8, 2024, 03:18:02 - Thomas Dinges: We never accepted cleanups or refactors during Beta.
Tue, Oct 8, 2024, 03:19:08 - Falk David: I'm also very confused by this.. I even asked about it in the projects meeting and the conclusion was that cleanups are ok in beta 
Tue, Oct 8, 2024, 03:19:08 - Jeroen Bakker: I'm not doing cleanups, only pointing out issues with the process
Tue, Oct 8, 2024, 03:20:46 - Jeroen Bakker: A developer knows better at the current state if a cleanup should be better to land in 4.3 or 4.4. To not allow it at forehand and be really strict on it will lead to other issues.
Tue, Oct 8, 2024, 03:21:43 - Thomas Dinges: I do believe that the intention was always clear. What changed lately is how strictly we follow things. During 4.2, feature have been commited or changed during Beta and even RC phase. This "let's do whatever" has to stop
Tue, Oct 8, 2024, 03:23:25 - Jeroen Bakker: I am not saying do whatever. You're clearly misunderstanding my point.
Tue, Oct 8, 2024, 03:24:12 - Falk David: <@thomasdinges:blender.org "I do believe that the intention ..."> Ok but `"let's do whatever" has to stop` is very different from strictly only allowing bug fixes. 
Tue, Oct 8, 2024, 03:26:12 - Falk David: Others can correct me if I'm wrong but to me the whole point of the beta is to reduce the number of bugs, not increase them. If there's a PR that doesn't add anything functionally new, why would it not be allowed to land in the release branch? 
Tue, Oct 8, 2024, 03:26:59 - Thomas Dinges: A cleanup always comes with a risk of adding new issues. And if people would follow the release cycles more closely, new / large features would land at the beginning of Alpha. Saying that cleanups are needed at this point of the release only tells me that GPv3 was merged too late and is now in a state where cleanups are needed
Tue, Oct 8, 2024, 03:27:35 - Thomas Dinges: Removing 40k lines of code is not what I expect during Beta.
Tue, Oct 8, 2024, 03:28:09 - Thomas Dinges: So the issue is not "no cleanups during Beta", the issue is that lately it was fine to add new major features too late or in a too incomplete state
Tue, Oct 8, 2024, 03:28:12 - Falk David: Again, this was talked about in the projects meeting and everyone was fine with it...
Tue, Oct 8, 2024, 03:28:23 - Thomas Dinges: That happened with EEVEE-Next, Extensions and now GPv3
Tue, Oct 8, 2024, 03:35:15 - Falk David: Sergey Bastien Montagne Would be nice to hear from you about this ^
Tue, Oct 8, 2024, 03:35:43 - Falk David: It's very frustrating when one party says this and then others say that... 
Tue, Oct 8, 2024, 03:35:52 - Falk David: Like what do you want me to do?
Tue, Oct 8, 2024, 03:40:42 - Bastien Montagne: Main issue here to me is that once again, we get not-really-ready projects still being worked on when entering Beta phase.
In an ideal world, these kind of 'cleanups' should have happened way earlier in release phase.
Given  what things are currently, imho it's better to sync these 'cleanups' between 4.3 and main, it indeed also makes syncing between both less painful
And I would rather not have 40k lines of 'almost dead code' (old GPv2 operators etc.) in 4.3 release.
_(mainly talking about GP case here, as I am not really aware of the two other ones mentioned by Thomas)_
Tue, Oct 8, 2024, 03:45:02 - Thomas Dinges: I was not suggesting to undo the cleanups for GPv3 now, it is what it is at this point. But it's yet another example (like Extensions and EEVEE-Next for 4.2), that things land in a non ready state and work has to continue during Beta. If we would follow our release cycle, development would be *Done* once we enter Beta and the only thing we do is react to bugs being reported.
Tue, Oct 8, 2024, 03:45:54 - Thomas Dinges: If there is a todo list of things that still need to be done (features, cleanups, api, performance....) this is not suitable for Beta imho
Tue, Oct 8, 2024, 03:47:11 - Bastien Montagne: Thomas Dinges: totally agree, but this is a general project management issue... it is known thing that we failed on that again for 4.3 ‚òπÔ∏è
Tue, Oct 8, 2024, 03:48:50 - Thomas Dinges: And I apologize for being so vocal, but since I took over release management duties ~2 years ago, I granted people exceptions every single release cycle. A deadline is not a deadline if I green light features that land 2 days later. This is very frustrating to me.
Tue, Oct 8, 2024, 03:50:49 - Thomas Dinges: A new feature should be ready for release once we enter Beta (apart from bugs being reported of course), and every further enhancement has to go to the next one. This is the whole point of the overlapping release cycle. 
Tue, Oct 8, 2024, 04:01:08 - Fiona Cohen: Hey, chiming in here, as I've been following those discussions as well, on and off the chat. What I understood we agreed on was:

- yes things should land early in Alpha, not late in Alpha then fix stuff as you go in Beta. In that, Thomas Dinges you are holding the line like you should.
- > But it is the _ideal_ we should strive to achieve
- GPv3 is fine as is, has been discussed many times what would happen in Beta (cleaning up etc) and greenlit by Sergey . That was very clear (cc Falk David )
- better to have a cleaned up GPv3 now that gets tested and into 4.3, than wait for 4.4 and not necessarily have better quality then
- for new and future projects: as discussed for example with Julian Eisel in the latest projects meeting (for Online Assets Library), we will aim to land early in Alpha, to avoid the issues we had with other projects, design discussions still going on after Alpha, etc.
- > But we do _not_ do projects based on release cycles... so sometimes, exceptions will still happen. They have to be discussed with the admin team and greenlit then. So all parties know the consequences.
Tue, Oct 8, 2024, 04:05:12 - Fiona Cohen: I understand this is frustrating when we make exceptions, what feels like 'all the time',
and when reminding people to deliver things now, or wait for the next release, is not followed clearly. [edit] But in the end it's not up to anyone to do anything, we should always peer-check.
For now, a better planning and anticipation, to communicate the impact those changes (late or not) have, is what we do. Sergey Dalai Felinto do you confirm?
Thomas Dinges does this sound more in line with what we had discussed?
Tue, Oct 8, 2024, 04:08:23 - Thomas Dinges: I am fine with this. I hope we will be more successful bringing things back to the ideal state in the future, so late changes become the exception again. 
Tue, Oct 8, 2024, 04:08:50 - Fiona Cohen: Yes, we will do better!
Tue, Oct 8, 2024, 04:56:19 - Jeroen Bakker: From project/release management point of view I still miss simple email where we could mention to all developers things we strive towards. The modern way of email is to have a 'read-only' channel where all developers should be invited to. Where we can highlight changes on governance/project quality. Some discord servers I participate use that. Perhaps something to consider to improve communication on these topics.

Currently some communications doesn't come through to all developers as they are not part of the 'discussion' in specific channels due to time-zone differences or focused on other tasks, or just not working at that time. Devtalk isn't also working in this case as those are more upcoming changes.

Something also to consider is to highlight why we do things. and not only what we should do. Communication should be clear to newcomers and to people already involved in the topic. Adding the why provides more clarity what is important to us and why we chose to work in a certain way.
Tue, Oct 8, 2024, 05:03:09 - Thomas Dinges: We could have an announcement channel on the chat? Not sure what exactly would go there though :) So far the closest thing to the old bf-commiters mailinglist is the announcement category on devtalk
Tue, Oct 8, 2024, 05:42:59 - LazyDodo: We likely need a better definition of what constitutes "a cleanup",  "cleanup: fix spelling error in comment"  and "cleanup: remove 40k loc of dead code" have a two rather different risk profiles, and while i could likely talk Thomas Dinges into allowing the first into 4.3, the second he's unlikely to allow and may even get a bit irked about, so they are clearly two different things.
Tue, Oct 8, 2024, 05:45:26 - Thomas Dinges: `cleanup: fix spelling error in comment` is a fix, no need to call that a cleanup
Tue, Oct 8, 2024, 05:45:54 - LazyDodo: see, we need a better definition üôÇ 
Tue, Oct 8, 2024, 05:49:16 - Sergey: Indeed communication should have been better. It wasn't the easiest decision, and it seemed to have been the least of the evils all things considered (project, schedule, people availability and motivation, many other factors).
All the project that are starting now we are really trying much harder to avoid the same mistakes that lead to this unideal situation, and structure and plan them better
Tue, Oct 8, 2024, 05:56:15 - Lukas T√∂nne: sooo, should i continue removing GPv2 code or leave it in this half-removed state? i'd prefer to be done with GPv3 (mostly) after 4.3, but there is quite a lot still to be removed
Tue, Oct 8, 2024, 05:57:07 - Thomas Dinges: Lukas T√∂nne: Go ahead with removing. 
Tue, Oct 8, 2024, 06:16:07 - LazyDodo: Bastien Montagne: any news on those blendfile_* test failures?
Tue, Oct 8, 2024, 06:20:08 - Bastien Montagne: LazyDodo: I thought this was over now, after Sergey's fixes? Is it still happening?
Tue, Oct 8, 2024, 06:21:34 - LazyDodo: <@lazydodo:blender.org "Bastien Montagne: doing validati..."> that was a different problem i think?
Tue, Oct 8, 2024, 06:22:27 - LazyDodo: there's a few other tests failing as well, like alembic, but it's all the same assert
Tue, Oct 8, 2024, 06:22:35 - Bastien Montagne: LazyDodo: I think this was reported and assigned to dev who introduced the regression?
Tue, Oct 8, 2024, 06:23:17 - Bastien Montagne: Jesse already gave link: https://projects.blender.org/blender/blender/issues/128420
Tue, Oct 8, 2024, 06:24:35 - LazyDodo: Julian Eisel: this has blocked my lib update for a week now, may i kindly but firmly ask you to "get on it already" ? 
Tue, Oct 8, 2024, 06:27:52 - Bastien Montagne: LazyDodo: I still do not fully understand this issue... as for me all tests pass fine (in debug + asan builds)...
Tue, Oct 8, 2024, 06:29:02 - LazyDodo: must be nice, but that's not helping me all that much üôÇ 
Tue, Oct 8, 2024, 06:29:50 - Bastien Montagne: LazyDodo: point being: I cannot reproduce, which does not help me having a better idea of the issue üòâ
Tue, Oct 8, 2024, 06:33:52 - LazyDodo: Bastien Montagne: i can repro 128420 out of the box, however when i chuck my `4.3\datafiles\assets\brushes\` folder, i get same warning you have and no crash
Tue, Oct 8, 2024, 06:34:34 - Bastien Montagne: yup... therefore "something" is wrong with these assets handling... somehow üòêÔ∏è
Tue, Oct 8, 2024, 06:36:34 - LazyDodo: hmm can you see if it starts crashing for you as well if you place the required files over at `/home/guest/.config/blender/4.3/datafiles/assets/brushes/` ?
Tue, Oct 8, 2024, 06:37:37 - LazyDodo: it's the .blends from `[source_folder]\release\datafiles\assets\publish\brushes\` by the looks of it
Tue, Oct 8, 2024, 06:57:41 - Lukas T√∂nne: last GPv2-removal patch for now. i want to stop now to avoid the drama and because review will be slow for the remainder of the week. lots more GPv2 stuff to remove but we don't have time/people to do it in 4.3
https://projects.blender.org/blender/blender/pulls/128709
Tue, Oct 8, 2024, 08:09:06 - Bastien Montagne: LazyDodo: assert itself should be gone now, in both 4.3 and main branches

Tue, Oct 8, 2024, 11:04:58 - pitched123: Hi, I'm completely new to contributing own changes to git. Only got so far as to follow the setup steps to contribute to the documentation

I suggested a change to the manual, got a confirmation that this is needed and now edited the .rst in my local clone. Which steps would I need to take in order to send this in as a potential official change?
I clicked "commit changes" in VS code a bit to early I think and now I'm not sure if that's sent as a commit or if it's all just editing my local files. Does somebody know how I can send in changes properly?

And help is appreciated. Sadly, online guides and steps to contribute didn't really clear it up for me yet
Tue, Oct 8, 2024, 11:29:07 - LazyDodo: the process for the manual is more or less the same as the code workflow, (but with different repositories naturally)
Tue, Oct 8, 2024, 11:29:18 - LazyDodo: you can find the documentation for that over at https://developer.blender.org/docs/handbook/contributing/pull_requests/

Tue, Oct 8, 2024, 19:46:49 - Aaron Carlisle: pitched123: I can help you if needed
Tue, Oct 8, 2024, 21:26:08 - nem: I need to texture paint with 32-bit colors without losing precision due to color space conversions for my specific art pipeline. The issue is that, regardless of texture or color management settings, Blender stores picked colors as sRGB for the brush, causing precision loss during the linear-to-sRGB conversion. Even when I manually set 32-bit values through a script (to bit-pack data into the colors), Blender still interprets them as sRGB.

My pipeline relies on bit-packing data into 32-bit color channels for texture painting. I need Blender to preserve these exact 32-bit values while texture painting and color picking and stop converting between color spaces, as it corrupts the data.

Anyone know if this is possible?
Tue, Oct 8, 2024, 21:30:56 - Wu Yiming: I think this is actually a important feature to have, but not sure how much stuff internally needs to be modified to support this
Tue, Oct 8, 2024, 21:31:40 - Wu Yiming: Do you have literal millions of different bit values needs to be distinguished? is it possible that you can use "values that are close" to identify stuff?
Tue, Oct 8, 2024, 21:32:19 - Wu Yiming: (I presume you are hand panting stuff, so I think you can work around it this way)
Tue, Oct 8, 2024, 22:10:29 - nem: yes im hand painting, but im using a custom addon to pack data into the colors. I'm bit packing three 8bit channels within the 32bits. The loss of precision is far too high.
Tue, Oct 8, 2024, 22:12:00 - Wu Yiming: ÂõæÁâá.png (Media omitted)
Tue, Oct 8, 2024, 22:12:13 - nem: on top of that, if you just set your brush color to something like (0, 0.5, 0), paint with it, then color pick that exact spot. that 0.5 will become 0.499997 and slowly creep down with each subsequent color pick and paint
Tue, Oct 8, 2024, 22:12:16 - Wu Yiming: You could set the texture color space to non-color data

Tue, Oct 8, 2024, 22:13:22 - nem: <@chengdulittlea:blender.org "Oh wait color picker seems to al..."> bingo
Tue, Oct 8, 2024, 22:13:38 - nem: that's the crux of my problem
Tue, Oct 8, 2024, 22:17:00 - nem: 32bit_test2.mp4 (Media omitted)
Tue, Oct 8, 2024, 22:17:17 - nem: ontop of that, it cant even preserve its own srgb value between color picking and painting
Tue, Oct 8, 2024, 22:17:50 - nem: here the red channel value slowly goes down with each new color pick and paint stroke
Tue, Oct 8, 2024, 22:18:18 - nem: and if you do it in the Image Editor (vs 3DView), the value goes up slowly 
Tue, Oct 8, 2024, 22:18:36 - nem: plus a bunch of other inconsistencies
Tue, Oct 8, 2024, 22:25:39 - nem: 32bit_test3.mp4 (Media omitted)
Tue, Oct 8, 2024, 22:26:14 - nem: here's a fun one. Painting in the Image Editor vs 3d viewport with the same color.
Tue, Oct 8, 2024, 22:26:55 - nem: then just color picking from one side and painting on the other with that color
Tue, Oct 8, 2024, 22:27:34 - nem: Seems the image editor isn't receiving the same srgb conversion that's causing the gamma correction
Tue, Oct 8, 2024, 22:28:00 - nem: but its also not persistent with its values.
Tue, Oct 8, 2024, 22:30:02 - Wu Yiming: srgb back and forth precision problem is actually present in a lot of other programs which where not initially designed for everything to be handled in linear space. MyPaint also had this problem
Tue, Oct 8, 2024, 22:34:00 - nem: ya, it seems like the obvious solution is to just use the relevant bit precision for the brush colors based on the textures color space and avoid all the conversions. 
Tue, Oct 8, 2024, 22:35:07 - nem: but I'm not sure how involved and tedious of a fix that would be.
Tue, Oct 8, 2024, 22:35:11 - Wu Yiming: yes technically that should be the solution, but to do this, other parts of the interface and other handlers will be modified and it may break some existing stuff, so we need to approach this carefully
Tue, Oct 8, 2024, 22:40:46 - nem: right, and the difference with how colors are even handled between 3dview and image editor is just a bigger indicator of how poorly-coupled the logic is.

The inverted quality range of DWA compression where 0 = lossless, 45 = "visually lossless", etc. is a convention in the EXR specifications and every other tool uses the EXR-native quality setting. This might cause more confusion than it helps IMHO.
Wed, Oct 9, 2024, 03:54:18 - Aras Pranckeviƒçius: The question is how to make it behave otherwise. Say you have ‚Äúquality‚Äù, and it is set to 95 and you output JPGs. Now you switch to EXR DWAA, and you‚Äôd have to change the quality to something else?
Wed, Oct 9, 2024, 03:54:33 - Aras Pranckeviƒçius: Or in VSE, ‚Äúproxy quality‚Äù is just one setting.
Wed, Oct 9, 2024, 03:54:53 - Aras Pranckeviƒçius: That maps to JPG quality directly, video quality indirectly, etc
Wed, Oct 9, 2024, 03:58:15 - SteffenD: Hmm... good question. But if you're changing JPG to EXR, you're also outputting data to another gamma (sRGB vs. linear), too. So they're 2 unrelated image formats that offer different features and settings (Alpha channel, float precision, ...)
Wed, Oct 9, 2024, 04:02:18 - SteffenD: Maybe if there was an info that shows the currently used compression ratio in EXR style, but you enter the quality JPEG-like? I.e. if you set the quality slider to 97, the info next to it shows 45. Just so you can output DWAA EXRs with a specified quality (e.g. if your comper wants DWAA compressed EXRs with "85" quality. What would this be mapped to in Blender's quality slider?
Wed, Oct 9, 2024, 04:04:59 - Aras Pranckeviƒçius: I was also kinda going by existing precedent that Jpeg-2000 in blender also takes in usual 1-100 jpg quality and maps that to "jpeg 2000 quality" which is entirely different scale.
Wed, Oct 9, 2024, 04:05:35 - SteffenD: OK, I never use JPEG-2000, so I didn't come across that ;)
Wed, Oct 9, 2024, 04:07:02 - Aras Pranckeviƒçius: I do get your point, and I think either approach has pros & cons. Your suggestion is better for people who _only_ work with exrs and are technical/professional enough. "usual jpg scale" might work better for "the rest of us". Not sure how to solve it so that both would be happy...
Wed, Oct 9, 2024, 04:12:57 - SteffenD: Fair point.
I'm just working in Fusion and there you can even set the ZIP compression level of EXR files. That range is in integers from 0 to 9. While the DWA compression is in float from 0 to 300. And with JPEG it is an integer between 0 and 100 and with JPEG 2000 a totally different range.
Blender slowly wants to adopt "industry standard" and I somehow feel like trying to be consistent with existing settings and user friendly might become a burden somewhen in the future. I don't know.
But right now I'm more than glad to finally be able to set the compression ratio instead of having it hard-coded.
Thanks a lot again :)
Wed, Oct 9, 2024, 04:18:17 - Aras Pranckeviƒçius: well in this particular case, "exr zip compression" and "exr dwa compression" are not the same things, actually. zip compression is more like "how much effort to spend trying to make file smaller". dwa compression is much more of a "how much quality"
Wed, Oct 9, 2024, 04:18:42 - Aras Pranckeviƒçius: but yes, it's an eternal struggle in how many settings to expose, how to name them, how to map them from one format/aspect to another, etc. etc. :/

Hello everyone,

I am new to open-source contributions and would like to set up the Blender source code locally. I have some basic knowledge of GitHub commands and i have few questions:

Question 1: I found the issue tracker on Gitea. Should I fork the repository to my Gitea account before setting up the project locally?

am i right?

Could you explain what are the expected return values inside the result buffer and how are they supposed to be sorted for each mode? Also how to test each mode?

```
/** Flags for mode of operation. */
enum eGPUSelectMode {
  GPU_SELECT_ALL = 1,
  /* gpu_select_query */
  GPU_SELECT_NEAREST_FIRST_PASS = 2,
  GPU_SELECT_NEAREST_SECOND_PASS = 3,
  /* gpu_select_pick */
  GPU_SELECT_PICK_ALL = 4,
  GPU_SELECT_PICK_NEAREST = 5,

If you want to take a look at the new (partial) implementation it is inside
`source/blender/draw/engines/select/select_instance.hh` and `source/blender/draw/engines/select/shaders/select_lib.glsl`

Wed, Oct 9, 2024, 16:07:10 - hamling: Hi.  My geometry nodes monstrosity has been crashing blender.  I'm an experienced C++ coder, but this is my first time digging into blender as I try to debug where things are going wrong.  I've got a debug build with extra memory checking (/fsanitize=address) turned on, and I think I have an idea about the immediate cause (materialize_to_uninitialized buffer overrun during processing of the indexed switch node) and a hunch about the root cause.  However I might be barking up the wrong tree entirely due to my limited understanding of the way masked indexing works.    Is there anyone who might be able to chat a bit and guide me as to whether I'm on the right track?  Also, since I'm new to this forum, is this an appropriate question to be asking here? (don't want to commit a newbie chat faux pas)
Wed, Oct 9, 2024, 16:09:21 - ideasman42: Cl√©ment Foucault:

- `GPU_SELECT_ALL` - all items - X-ray selection).
- `GPU_SELECT_NEAREST_FIRST_PASS` & `GPU_SELECT_NEAREST_SECOND_PASS` - .... depth occluded selection, unordered, no per-pixel depth information is accessible.
The 2x passes are part of the implementation which requires drawing twice.
- `GPU_SELECT_PICK_ALL` depth ordered all items in the region, nearest ordered.
- `GPU_SELECT_PICK_NEAREST` -depth ordered all items _occluded_, where any fully occluded pixels are omitted.

NOTE: `GPU_SELECT_PICK_*` would be quite inefficient for large regions which is why there are selection modes for picking.
Wed, Oct 9, 2024, 16:14:52 - ideasman42: From the point of efficient OpenGL use, It would have been good if we could removed `GPU_SELECT_PICK_ALL` & `GPU_SELECT_PICK_NEAREST`, as it's pretty bad to be reading the buffer every draw, the problem is occlusion-queries don't store per-pixel depth.
So, when "Depth Picking" is disabled, clicking to pick items in the 3D view (multiple times) will cycle through the items in a random order (random from user POV, it may use the draw-order internally).
Wed, Oct 9, 2024, 16:15:45 - ideasman42: Ideally new selection logic could support per-pixel depth so we could record the "hits" & the depth for each hit.

Wed, Oct 9, 2024, 16:46:15 - gwenp: Hey :) I'm reading hamling post and also the LazyDodo's answer (I'm having the same fear of "newbie chat faux pas") . I'm a newcomer here also.

Lately I've been trying to make a blend file parser for the browser in order to read encapsulated data such as geometry nodes, meshes, ...
I've found an old parser on github and it _kind of_ works. I mean for most of the objects registered in the blend file it works, but last commit on this project was several years ago.

I'd like to freshen that parser so that it might be useful to be and other people.

I've been strugling with mesh handling. it seems like before, geometry data was stored in "mloop", "mvert", "mfaces" and "mpoly".
Now it seems like it is stored in "ldata", "vdata", "fdata" and "pdata", which are handling their internal data with "CustomDataLayer".

It is possible that this change happened a long time ago.

But here is my problem :
With a blend file containing only few simple meshes (a cube, a cone, ...)

- I manage to retreive vertices data ‚úÖÔ∏è I can loop over vertices and retreive their positions
- I manage to retreive loop data ‚úÖÔ∏è I can get indexes and associate them withvertices
- however, face and poly data seems empty (nothing relevant in any CustomDataLayer) ‚ùåÔ∏è I found a "DrawDataList" in "pdata" but I don't think it is related to faces or polys

So what I tried to diagnose :
Maybe the code is wrong on my side and fdata or pdata should have some face, or i'm not understanding how it actually works

Is there some documentation somewhere about that moment when the blend file format started using CustomDataLayers?
Or maybe, is there another chan or place to talk about the blend file format, and how to read it? Or some documentation I missed about the file format or data structures?
Wed, Oct 9, 2024, 16:50:02 - LazyDodo: the .blend format is considered internal and can change on a whim, our general advise is not to parse it 
Wed, Oct 9, 2024, 16:51:07 - LazyDodo: however if you're determined to stay on this path, the code in `source\blender\blenloader\intern\` will be of value as it will show you all the data transforms being done for reading older versions
Wed, Oct 9, 2024, 16:51:13 - LazyDodo: which is.... quite a bit....
Wed, Oct 9, 2024, 16:52:21 - gwenp: Ok. Is there any piece of advice then on how to retreive information from a browser? Such as the number of meshes, objects, ...? There is a python API but I think it's not to be considered for web without a server(thinking about React components and that kind of things)
Wed, Oct 9, 2024, 16:54:21 - gwenp: <@lazydodo:blender.org "which is.... quite a bit...."> Even if it is a hard to start subject i'm willing to learn and not having a lot to do at the moment :).
Is there any changelog stored somewhere concerning file format deprecations? I'll dig into the "blenloader" folder, thank you very much !
Wed, Oct 9, 2024, 16:55:38 - LazyDodo: there's no "format" really, .blend files are pretty much raw dumps of whatever structs blender uses and they change.... a lot...
Wed, Oct 9, 2024, 16:58:29 - Alaska: The main issue you're facing at the moment is the change in geometry layout. I believe this occured in 4.0, and code to convert the new geometry layout into the old one was added to 3.6 LTS.
So you might be able to find something useful in the [3.6 LTS change logs](https://www.blender.org/download/lts/3-6/) or commit history.
Wed, Oct 9, 2024, 17:00:32 - Alaska: If the conversion from the 4.0 mesh data to 3.6 mesh data has high quality code comments, then it could help you understand the new data layout.
Wed, Oct 9, 2024, 17:06:14 - gwenp: That is amazing! Considered what I've tested so far i'm able to parse geometry from old files (maybe 3.x) and i've got problems with files from recent blender versions. So it might be exactly that.

I know that the file format can change a lot but i'm interested in a very little sprectrum of what is actually saved (basic geometries and meshes).

So that might help me a lot in parsing them with js. And if it changes at some point, I've been warned ! 

Thank you.

This happens when I add the line `RNA_def_property_enum_funcs_runtime(prop, nullptr, RNA_node_socket_interface_menu_set_ex, nullptr);` to `rna_def_node_socket_interface_menu`. Any idea why this is causing the RNA to be generated weirdly?

Thu, Oct 10, 2024, 05:28:21 - Raimund58: Sebastian Parborg: If you wanted, you could save even more space by compressing the .blend files with an external zstd tool to the max.
Blender can still open it if it was compressed by external tools
Thu, Oct 10, 2024, 05:33:28 - Jacques Lucke: Does anyone else get this build error in a release build (wayland related)? ideasman42

Thu, Oct 10, 2024, 05:33:56 - Wu Yiming: I think you need to reset the git lib
Thu, Oct 10, 2024, 05:34:00 - Wu Yiming: I had this yesterday
Thu, Oct 10, 2024, 05:34:40 - Jacques Lucke: Oh, it looks a bit broken indeed, how does that happen?
Thu, Oct 10, 2024, 05:35:33 - Wu Yiming: I think a lot of times I `git pull` I need to manually reset lib or asset. Most of time it wasn't a problem I just do that when I see there's a thing showing in vscode
Thu, Oct 10, 2024, 05:35:42 - Jacques Lucke: How did you reset it? Just clone again or is there a smarter way?
Thu, Oct 10, 2024, 05:36:11 - Wu Yiming: ÂõæÁâá.png (Media omitted)
Thu, Oct 10, 2024, 05:36:35 - LazyDodo: i.....i'm not sure that helps? üôÇ
Thu, Oct 10, 2024, 05:36:37 - Wu Yiming: If there's a problem there will be a line showing the submodule and there's a "undo" "add" looking button
Thu, Oct 10, 2024, 05:36:52 - Wu Yiming: just click that "undo" (I guess that's the revert) works for me
Thu, Oct 10, 2024, 05:37:07 - LazyDodo: Jacques Lucke: try a `git pull + git checkout main` in that folder ?
Thu, Oct 10, 2024, 05:37:20 - Wu Yiming: or maybe `cd` into the submodule and `git reset --hard origin/main`, should do the trick
Thu, Oct 10, 2024, 05:39:24 - Jacques Lucke: Couldn't make it work yet, I'm a bit confused
Thu, Oct 10, 2024, 05:40:30 - Wu Yiming: did `git status` show anything?
Thu, Oct 10, 2024, 05:42:08 - Jacques Lucke: ```

```
Thu, Oct 10, 2024, 05:42:52 - Jacques Lucke: I'm on `main` in the main repo and in the lib repo afaik, still get the same error
Thu, Oct 10, 2024, 05:43:29 - Wu Yiming: ü§î not sure `ninja` vs `make` have any differences
Thu, Oct 10, 2024, 05:43:53 - Wu Yiming: if in doubt, just nuke the build directory ü´†
Thu, Oct 10, 2024, 05:44:32 - Sebastian Parborg: <@raimund58:blender.org "Sebastian Parborg: If you wanted..."> Do you have any stats on how much you gain from that? I'm guessing that opening files might become very slow if you crank up the compression level
Thu, Oct 10, 2024, 05:44:58 - Jacques Lucke: yeah, that's probably what I'll end up doing, but weird anyway, especially since you had it too
Thu, Oct 10, 2024, 05:45:41 - Wu Yiming: you have git in any of your IDEs that may give a hint? (but considering git status clean, I'm not sure what is going on)
Thu, Oct 10, 2024, 05:46:38 - Jacques Lucke: in vscode it looks all as usual
Thu, Oct 10, 2024, 05:49:18 - Alaska: Zstd is known for having very fast decompression. So yes it will slow down, but probably not much (and it may actually be faster in some cases if you have a fast processor and slow storage).
As for how much compression you can get. I've been seeing 10x compression on some .blend files using Blender's standard zstd compression. But it obviously depends on content (I think meshes compress well, but already compressed media (E.g. Images) don't compression well)
Thu, Oct 10, 2024, 05:52:05 - Raimund58: Sebastian Parborg: This is the implemantation: https://projects.blender.org/blender/blender/commit/2ea66af742bca4b427f88de13254414730a33776
The current compression level in Blender is set to 3. Zstd allows levels up to 22 iirc
Loading will be slower for sure, but I don't have stats for you
Thu, Oct 10, 2024, 05:56:06 - Sebastian Parborg: As we cut the full repository size in almost half with compression, I would guess that a higher compression level might bring it to be more than half. However I wouldn't expect it to bring any huge gains
Thu, Oct 10, 2024, 05:56:13 - Sebastian Parborg: I could be wrong of course
Thu, Oct 10, 2024, 06:12:40 - Dalai Felinto: Wu Yiming: I think [4c57c171b3bee45e60515](https://projects.blender.org/blender/blender/commit/4c57c171b3bee45e60515c2d57802034fefd478b) should have been fixed in 4.3 (instead of main). Could you please cherry-pick it to 4.3? (and also add it to the 4.2LTS list of future fixes).
Thu, Oct 10, 2024, 06:13:32 - Wu Yiming: Will do. Thanks for the reminder
Thu, Oct 10, 2024, 06:13:36 - Dalai Felinto: Also I was surprised you committed the fix right away. Maybe double-check with ideasman42 that the fix is sound.
Thu, Oct 10, 2024, 06:13:42 - Dalai Felinto: and thanks for looking into that
Thu, Oct 10, 2024, 06:14:07 - Wu Yiming: Ah I thought that one liner logic is simple enough üòÖ
Thu, Oct 10, 2024, 06:18:04 - Dalai Felinto: well code-review aside, a PR review would have caught the "wrong" branch, and lack of mention that is intended for 4.2 :) (hopefully? anyways I'm glad I was following that bug)
Thu, Oct 10, 2024, 06:19:02 - Wu Yiming: ü´° Ah I see yeah... a PR could be have more use than exposing code bugs indeed
Thu, Oct 10, 2024, 06:19:13 - Raimund58: No idea. It is always a balance between file size and useability. 
If you want to save max space, compress with level 22 and other tweaks.
If you want to keep a balance continue with your current method.
If you want to save a few seconds while resaving all .blend files you could use zstd directly, no need to open a new blender process and load all referenced files for every .blend.
Thu, Oct 10, 2024, 06:19:30 - Wu Yiming: I'll make sure I make a PR next time for stuff like this 
Thu, Oct 10, 2024, 06:24:15 - SteffenD: Is projects.blender.org down?
Thu, Oct 10, 2024, 06:27:37 - LazyDodo: half? i'ts definitely responding 
Thu, Oct 10, 2024, 06:27:43 - LazyDodo: but it just says "Verify"
Thu, Oct 10, 2024, 06:27:45 - Wu Yiming: it says "verify" for me
Thu, Oct 10, 2024, 06:27:50 - LazyDodo: Bart van der Braak: ^^
Thu, Oct 10, 2024, 06:28:05 - Bart van der Braak: We're investigating
Thu, Oct 10, 2024, 06:28:25 - LazyDodo: would you say you are verifying something?
Thu, Oct 10, 2024, 06:29:40 - Sergey: projects went on an early weekend :)
Thu, Oct 10, 2024, 06:31:00 - Sergey: Can you give some context?
Thu, Oct 10, 2024, 06:32:25 - Wu Yiming: Sergey: blender will crash when baking line art (it will change frames and call scene updates) and interface would come to redraw a image editor and there it didn't get valid evaluated view layer
Thu, Oct 10, 2024, 06:32:37 - Wu Yiming: Without image editor then no crash
Thu, Oct 10, 2024, 06:36:54 - Bart van der Braak: Should be back

Thu, Oct 10, 2024, 06:38:07 - LazyDodo: just pour a recovery potion into the machine, be sure to hit the ram sticks
Thu, Oct 10, 2024, 06:38:25 - Arnd: I cast magic missile
Thu, Oct 10, 2024, 06:38:42 - Arnd: (it was super effective!)
Thu, Oct 10, 2024, 06:38:54 - Wu Yiming: yay it's recovered
Thu, Oct 10, 2024, 06:41:41 - Sergey: Arnd:  magic missle never misses, there is no AC check for it. is just 1d4 damage
also, dont forget to upcast it if you have higher level spell slots, it adds one extra dart per level above 1
Thu, Oct 10, 2024, 06:43:25 - Sergey: Anthony Roberts: Hey! Something you can verify locally https://builder.blender.org/admin/#/builders/244/builds/213 ?
(failing `cycles_image_colorspace_cpu` on WoA)
Thu, Oct 10, 2024, 06:44:39 - Anthony Roberts: Checking now
Thu, Oct 10, 2024, 06:51:26 - Arnd: Sergey: I never use for damage, just to attack the darkness
Thu, Oct 10, 2024, 07:09:19 - Anthony Roberts: It's all fun and games until your DM takes it seriously, like ours did once, and you accidentally party wipe as you were trying to stealth something
Thu, Oct 10, 2024, 07:11:12 - Anthony Roberts: Sergey: Latest tip of main gives no fails on my machine
Thu, Oct 10, 2024, 08:28:29 - Sergey: Anthony Roberts: Oki, thanks for testing! I'll keep an eye on it, and see whats gogin on. The incremental builds seems to be fine on buildbot as well. So.. Tomorrow we'll know if daily builds passes

Thu, Oct 10, 2024, 12:14:39 - Iliya Katushenock: Which one?

Thu, Oct 10, 2024, 12:15:49 - Iliya Katushenock: Or do you looking for the notes from kickof?
Thu, Oct 10, 2024, 12:17:29 - rohithmatham: Yeah anything is fine. I need the logs from a recent Blender developer meeting , i think the above would be fine.

Fri, Oct 11, 2024, 01:27:25 - Falk David: ideasman42 I'm getting some compiler warning on the release branch:
```bash

```
Fri, Oct 11, 2024, 01:30:43 - Sergey: The `#if` needs to include version check, and ignore clang
Fri, Oct 11, 2024, 01:32:18 - Sergey: And it is also quite weird to suppress such a warning without any further explanation, or explicit acknolegement that it is false-positive.
Fri, Oct 11, 2024, 01:47:07 - Sergey: Anthony Roberts: Hey! Does Windows / WoA have a concept of "universal binary" (you know how on macOS you can combine two executable together, and let the system to choose the native one on startup) ?
Fri, Oct 11, 2024, 01:59:10 - Anthony Roberts: Sergey: Not to my knowledge, no - typically the approach taken by people like mozilla for firefox is that you download a "thin" installer compiled for x64, which then detects the arch of the machine and downloads the proprer "full fat" installer for the correct arch from the internet and executes it
Fri, Oct 11, 2024, 03:59:38 - ideasman42: Testing fix.
Fri, Oct 11, 2024, 04:03:27 - ideasman42: ... committed.
Fri, Oct 11, 2024, 04:43:36 - LazyDodo: Sergey: not a thing, guess they didn't want to mess with the pe/coff format

Fri, Oct 11, 2024, 09:56:09 - Sebastian Parborg: Sirgienko: Hello! I'm trying to get reproducible builds for `dpcpp`. Just setting `SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH` works for most things, but the `libsycl-*.o` files in `dpcpp/lib/` differs between compiles.
It seems like random hashes are used from some files in the .o files.

For example for `libsycl-fallback-cstring.o` the there is `fallback-cstring-cdad86.cpp` where the `cdad86` changes between recompiles.
Is there anyway to make these static?

Fri, Oct 11, 2024, 15:21:00 - orionsehn1: Hello, I was wondering if I could reach out for advice picking a project as a first contribution. 

I have an idea, that I'd really like to be able to support strings a bit better in the geometry nodes spreadsheet workspace. 


import bpy
tablemesh = bpy.data.meshes.new('sampletable')
tablemesh.vertices.add(2)

tablemesh.attributes.new("test_name", "STRING", "POINT")
tablemesh.attributes['test_name'].data[0].value = "Bob"
tablemesh.attributes['test_name'].data[1].value = "Alice"

tablemesh.attributes.new("test_num", "INT", "POINT")
tablemesh.attributes['test_num'].data[0].value = 1
tablemesh.attributes['test_num'].data[1].value = 2

obj = bpy.data.objects.new("a sample mesh object", tablemesh)
bpy.context.collection.objects.link(obj) 
bpy.context.view_layer.objects.active = obj
print("tablemesh.attributes['test_name'].data[0].value: ", tablemesh.attributes['test_name'].data[0].value)
print("tablemesh.attributes['test_name'].data[1].value: ", tablemesh.attributes['test_name'].data[1].value)
print("tablemesh.attributes['test_num'].data[0].value: ", tablemesh.attributes['test_num'].data[0].value)
print("tablemesh.attributes['test_num'].data[1].value: ", tablemesh.attributes['test_num'].data[1].value)



Fri, Oct 11, 2024, 15:22:17 - orionsehn1: Any chance I could get some advice on what kind of work would be required to get this a bit better supported, or if there's anybody else working on this. I did a quick search and I couldn't find anybody else working on that right now. 
Fri, Oct 11, 2024, 15:23:29 - Iliya Katushenock: Well, there is some reasons to do not do anything to support string attribute in current state
Fri, Oct 11, 2024, 15:23:48 - orionsehn1: Hmm yeah? 
Fri, Oct 11, 2024, 15:25:03 - orionsehn1: There's actively some reasons that supporting these would collide with other changes?
Fri, Oct 11, 2024, 15:25:15 - orionsehn1: or features
Fri, Oct 11, 2024, 15:25:58 - orionsehn1: I figured it was just something that hasn't yet been gotten to yet
Fri, Oct 11, 2024, 15:31:05 - Iliya Katushenock: 1. There is no use cases for string attribute in the geometry nodes
2. String attribute requires more smart/cheap representation in the memory rather then just an array of `std::string`'s
Fri, Oct 11, 2024, 15:39:10 - orionsehn1: Our use case involves using a mesh to visualize a network, and visualizing the vertex attributes on that mesh would be handy for our use case in network analysis. I could see the the memory allocation being an issue, but I figure because so few people would actually use it exactly the way we are, that it wouldn't hurt anything to just show string attributes when they exist? 

Also having the spreadsheet just show empty values for strings feels incomplete. Though I doubt too many people are going to run into that the same way we did, because not many people put string attributes on vertices. I could just write an add-on to do this, but I thought there might be some benefit to others so I figured I'd offer to contribute first.
Fri, Oct 11, 2024, 15:43:21 - Iliya Katushenock: No one will use this in us way | we do simple thing - display text | allocations will not be an issue
So its such a large amoung of the text so you should use geometry nodes? Or you could use Text Object?
No one will use that in this way? But what for this could be used, if not only for such a case?

Fri, Oct 11, 2024, 15:48:27 - Iliya Katushenock: In any case, as i know no one is working for this task right now, i think this links will help to you

Fri, Oct 11, 2024, 15:51:13 - orionsehn1: Yeah the networks we're visualizing are in the order of millions of verts. It makes sense for us to be able to have a place to visualize, filter, and search in a tabular format. Might be too much of a niche use case to be worth contributing meaningfully for everyone.
Fri, Oct 11, 2024, 15:51:57 - orionsehn1: <@mod:blender.org "orionsehn1: Did you tried latest..."> I did not, last I checked was 4.2 I think

can somebody please tell me what the names "bmain" and "bcontext" are?
I would assume 'b' just stands for "Blender", but at least for struct Main there seems to be a next Main and a prev Main. And I do not understand what a main is if there is a linked list of them. Would assume there is only 1 Blender Main. But maybe it means something else?
Thank you for your help.
Sat, Oct 12, 2024, 09:40:11 - LukasStockner: If I remember correctly, there may be multiple of them in the context of e.g. linking, and generally when multiple .blend files are involved
Sat, Oct 12, 2024, 09:40:58 - Philip-Schroeder: Aha, so I have 1 Blender Main per open Blend file you say?
Sat, Oct 12, 2024, 09:41:11 - LukasStockner: But for most code, there is only one bmain that matters
Sat, Oct 12, 2024, 09:41:31 - Philip-Schroeder: Ok, so b is indeed b = Blender?

Mon, Oct 14, 2024, 04:08:37 - Cl√©ment Foucault: LazyDodo Sergey : sooo seems like cmake doesn't refresh the content of a file even if its original file is updated.
```
/mnt/data/Blender/blender/source/blender/draw/intern/shaders/draw_debug_info.hh
```
 It was previously wrongly generated by the glsl_preprocessor (last monday fackup). But it seems that this stale version sticks even after the source file `draw_debug_info.hh` gets updated.

 Any pointers?

Mon, Oct 14, 2024, 06:02:32 - Memm: Hi, can anyone explain how to find out which C struct the bpy_struct as_pointer() points to? For example `C.edit_object.data.vertices[0].as_pointer()` gives the memory address, but which internal C struct does this apply to? I looked through the RNA generation to try and find the answer but it's not very easy to figure out
Mon, Oct 14, 2024, 06:08:07 - memm changed their display name to Memm
Mon, Oct 14, 2024, 06:08:51 - Memm set a profile picture
Mon, Oct 14, 2024, 06:11:16 - Cl√©ment Foucault: Long story short (thanks a lot to sergey for looking into it):

The line `file(GENERATE OUTPUT ${shader_create_info_list_file} CONTENT "${SHADER_CREATE_INFOS_CONTENT}")` breaks dependency tracking between create infos and the gpu module.

Which means that any changes to the `info.hh` files are not tracked properly. It w√∏rks by accident on the buildbot because it runs CMake for each build.

Mon, Oct 14, 2024, 06:19:23 - LazyDodo: is this fixed now?

Mon, Oct 14, 2024, 10:56:09 - ethan-hall: The deprecation of alpha clip blend mode, has made it cumbersome (for game developers in particular) to set up this common effect. Would it be reasonable to add the alpha clip setup (identical to the gltf importer's alpha clip setup) as a hotkey (maybe ALT+C) in the node wrangler addon?

Mon, Oct 14, 2024, 11:17:14 - Miguel Pozo: ethan-hall: You can use a single Greater Than node instead.
Mon, Oct 14, 2024, 11:27:02 - Jesse Y: For 0.5 you can use a single Round node, but for the others you need this setup because some formats, like USD and glTF, define their alpha-clip equivalent in terms of "greater than equals" and blender has no Greater Than Equals 
Mon, Oct 14, 2024, 14:53:10 - Sean Kim: Is there a way to tell when an object becomes inactive? There's some cleanup / conversion work that needs to happen that's similar to leaving the mode of an object

Edit: Never mind, think I've found it, `rna_ObjectBase_select_update`
Edit Edit: Actually this is probably way too low level for what I need, back to the drawing board

Mon, Oct 14, 2024, 18:12:18 - ideasman42: That's strange, please always include the compiler & version when mentioning these kinds of warnings. Clang-18.1.8 & GCC-14.2.1 don't generate warnings.
Mon, Oct 14, 2024, 18:27:17 - John Kiril Swenson: Why is it that some keymaps don't show up unless you search for them in the Keymap preferences? E.g. you can't find `km_time_scrub` or `km_time_scrub_clip` items until you look up "change frame." Is it because they only have 1 item each?

I think this could lead to trouble; if you accidentally delete the items there's no way of restoring them from the preferences interface as far as I can tell, other than restoring everything to default

(I ask because I'm trying to fix a bug related to those items)

https://projects.blender.org/blender/blender/src/branch/blender-v4.3-release/release/text/readme.html

README needs to be updated to chat.blender.org channels.
And maybe instead of User Forum we link to blender.org/community instead of BA?
Tue, Oct 15, 2024, 03:56:58 - Thomas Dinges: Fine with me, I can do that. Pablo Vazquez Any comments or objections? ^^
Tue, Oct 15, 2024, 03:58:01 - Dalai Felinto: I was about to do it but then had to remember how to link to a channel now, ... and it was getting me distracted from the daunting font license task :)
Tue, Oct 15, 2024, 03:58:30 - Dalai Felinto: `/me` found this by trying to find if Blender even ships with a .ttf these days, then I found the readme.html, and surprise, it was outdated :/
Tue, Oct 15, 2024, 04:01:54 - Pablo Vazquez: eeek we were linking straight to blenderartists? better do blender.org/community indeed 
Tue, Oct 15, 2024, 04:16:57 - Thomas Dinges: Dalai Felinto: Pablo Vazquez Updated the readme.html [888473b0642d](https://projects.blender.org/blender/blender/commit/888473b0642df8d4eb11b00b74bdc1e690bfa158)
Tue, Oct 15, 2024, 05:07:14 - Thomas Dinges: We have plenty of libraries right now, are all of them still used? (updating third party license documentation right now): https://projects.blender.org/blender/blender/pulls/129018#issuecomment-1318872 (Expand the list)
Tue, Oct 15, 2024, 05:08:34 - Thomas Dinges: I already heard that glew is not used anymore
Tue, Oct 15, 2024, 05:55:46 - LazyDodo: There's some questionable things in there thomas, where you pretty much will have to dive into what is expected from us, cause i honestly don't know
Tue, Oct 15, 2024, 05:56:46 - LazyDodo: ie flex, it's a build time dep, we _need_ it to build OSL (it generates OSL's parser), but we don't actually ship it
Tue, Oct 15, 2024, 05:59:15 - LazyDodo: same goes for ispc and nasm
Tue, Oct 15, 2024, 06:00:11 - LazyDodo: dpc++ we ship to devs, but beyond its compiler output we don't ship it to end users
Tue, Oct 15, 2024, 06:00:52 - LazyDodo: Message deleted
Tue, Oct 15, 2024, 06:19:04 - Dalai Felinto: LazyDodo: I think he means more like ... is there any library which Blender doesn't use at all, and we forgot to remove as a depedency
Tue, Oct 15, 2024, 06:19:25 - Dalai Felinto: (which was the case for glew, since we use epoxy now and glew was just dead weight on the code)
Tue, Oct 15, 2024, 06:31:59 - LazyDodo: Dalai Felinto: my point is "depends on your definition of the word 'used'"
Tue, Oct 15, 2024, 06:32:46 - LazyDodo: harbfbuzz for instance, blender doesn't use _at all_, but we definitely didn't forget to remove it , it's there since the UI module asked for preliminary libs, so they could work on integrating it
Tue, Oct 15, 2024, 06:42:09 - Dalai Felinto: interesting, it does mean that technically we shouldn't mention harbfbuzz on the license doc
Tue, Oct 15, 2024, 06:43:22 - LazyDodo: the same can be said for ispc/nasm/flex, we ship the artifacts it produces, but we don't actually ship any of its actual binaries
Tue, Oct 15, 2024, 06:43:51 - Thomas Dinges: LukasStockner: Hey, did you ever look into updating zstd? We're on 1.5.0 since the initial inclusion 2 years ago, current one is 1.5.6 and these point releases since then brought both fixes and further performance improvements. Just an idea :)
Tue, Oct 15, 2024, 06:44:13 - LazyDodo: Thomas Dinges:  think we got stuck on some version because of sometihng python causing linkage issues when you mixed versions
Tue, Oct 15, 2024, 06:45:10 - Dalai Felinto: Thomas Dinges: what do you think? we could have SET(LIBNAME_NOTUSED) or something
Tue, Oct 15, 2024, 06:45:43 - Thomas Dinges: More like LIBNAME_NOTSHIPPED? I mean if they are used as dependency for libs?
Tue, Oct 15, 2024, 06:46:03 - LazyDodo: `LIBNAME_BUILDTIMEONLY` ? or perhaps `LIBNAME_DEPSBUILDTIMEONLY` ?
Tue, Oct 15, 2024, 06:46:28 - Thomas Dinges: I already have a headache. Would prefer to do one thing at a time, which is porting everything from OSS to the new system. Cleanups and further improvements can be done later
Tue, Oct 15, 2024, 06:46:57 - Dalai Felinto: hehe, I feel you

Tue, Oct 15, 2024, 15:30:11 - Sean Kim: I think i'll just hold off on making the `make format` change since it seems to be in a weird / unexpected state, it's kinda ugly for the CI but I don't think its urgent

I don't think I could have screwed up with the library bump either as there is only 2 .py files that changed (code wise, the rest is just metadata installed by the libraries)

Should do the trick, just want to check all the python modules download, install, and work properly on all three main operating systems.  Didn't want to buy a mac, so I was installing blender and my addons at the local computer store earlier.  Got some stack traces, cycled 3 miles home, fixed the problems, re-uploaded to dropbox, and then went back and installed blender again + the 4 GB of libraries and models :D  Thankfully only needed 2 trips :)
Tue, Oct 15, 2024, 15:47:16 - LazyDodo: also think there may be a rather sizable difference between home users and the studio's that participated in the survey, things like redhat/centos are mainly attractive for corporate envs home user will likely want something flashier

Not sure if the buildbot will catch it since it looks like the GPU build task is set to disabled on that build. I can file a report if anyone thinks there's value, but don't want to spam devs if it's not worth the trouble.
Tue, Oct 15, 2024, 20:53:59 - LazyDodo: not sure what you want us to do here? it's an msvc limitation
Tue, Oct 15, 2024, 20:54:45 - Nikhil.Net: there was a post on an issue (wrong # - finding it now) that an include had fixed it and was not sure if this was a similar situation.  Like I said, just checking to make sure it was even actionable. Or, if it's a known issue, is it worth just suppressing C2719?  Seems emitting known warnings is probably not optimal.  But maybe that's my OCD talking. (Also, for what it's worth, disabling that preprocessor check does compile without any warnings, but I don't have an Intel GPU to test if the generated kernel is OK or not.)
Tue, Oct 15, 2024, 20:57:24 - LazyDodo: I'll leave it up to xavierh

you can get statistics from blender benchmark submissions, from what I remember there is a tie between Arch Linux and Ubuntu - quite different from what studio use :)

I've checked the source: this message is not really actionable, and it's not even a  warning. C2719 would be an error, this message talks about C2719 but is just a message coming from here: https://github.com/intel/llvm/blob/d2817d6d317db1143bb227168e85c409d5ab7c82/sycl/include/sycl/types.hpp#L331
It will be gone by upgrading to newer DPC++ versions: the fix was to update the spec so max alignment could be 64, which aligns with MSVC limitations.
If we want, the ` #pragma message` can be patched out from `include/sycl/types.hpp` without recompiling.

Wed, Oct 16, 2024, 01:57:53 - Sergey: It is only Linux which has new autopep8. Windows and macOS are still on the old one. If the formatting result is so different, it'll be a mess unless we can quickly align them

Wed, Oct 16, 2024, 02:00:56 - Sergey: Jonas Holzman: Hey, any status update on the autopep8? Shall i help with that to reduce the mess? :)
Wed, Oct 16, 2024, 02:01:11 - Sergey: Falk David: Its not only `main` btw, the autopep8 was aiming 4.3
Wed, Oct 16, 2024, 02:01:26 - Falk David: Yea I just noticed it's in 4.3 as well
Wed, Oct 16, 2024, 02:01:44 - Falk David: my pre-commit hook won't let me push üòÖ
Wed, Oct 16, 2024, 02:02:21 - Sergey: Since the majority of devs are on linux, shall we just run the formatter and catch up with autopep8 on mac/windows ASAP ?
Wed, Oct 16, 2024, 02:02:40 - Sergey: ideasman42 Bastien Montagne Any strong opinions?
Wed, Oct 16, 2024, 02:04:39 - Bastien Montagne: Sergey: not a strong one, but opinion would be to try to catch up on windows/OSX ASAP yes...
Easy to say since I don't think I can help on either though ‚òπÔ∏è
Wed, Oct 16, 2024, 02:04:59 - Bastien Montagne: But if it's too much of a mess, not against reverting to 1.6 on linux for the time being either
Wed, Oct 16, 2024, 02:06:39 - Sergey: I think it's better to:
- make format in 4.3, merge to main
- fix the warning making 2.3.1 the official expected autopep8
- motivate platform maintainers to do updates on Windows / macOS

Wed, Oct 16, 2024, 02:08:29 - Bastien Montagne: Sergey: I can do the make format and fix the warning...
Wed, Oct 16, 2024, 02:08:45 - Sean Kim: One weird thing mentioned earlier about the initial PR updating the autopep8 to 2.3.1 on linux is that there werent any files affected 
Wed, Oct 16, 2024, 02:09:23 - Sergey: Bastien Montagne: Lovely! I'm doing some `make update` / `make deps` dances on the macos machine
Wed, Oct 16, 2024, 02:09:33 - Bastien Montagne: The biggest change seems to be adding space between keywords and parenthesis
Wed, Oct 16, 2024, 02:10:17 - Sergey: Sean Kim: Yeah that is odd. Perhaps a mistake during testing?
Wed, Oct 16, 2024, 02:11:05 - Sean Kim: Dunno, Lazy and Sebastian both mentioned they didnt notice it during initial testing either 
Wed, Oct 16, 2024, 02:11:28 - Bastien Montagne: Any preference for the `MIN_VERSION`? `2.3.0` ?
Wed, Oct 16, 2024, 02:11:50 - Bastien Montagne: Or should we keep min and max the same as currently (`1.6.0`)?
Wed, Oct 16, 2024, 02:12:04 - ideasman42: When I ran the formatter, the result was the same on 1.6 & 2.3.1.
So I didn't think it would be an issue to have the older version on other platforms for a short time.
Wed, Oct 16, 2024, 02:13:08 - Bastien Montagne: ideasman42: there are quite a few differences here for me!
Wed, Oct 16, 2024, 02:13:12 - Sergey: ideasman42: Hrm. That's odd. The formatting is different for buildbot and for Falk =\
Wed, Oct 16, 2024, 02:13:14 - ideasman42: We should have min version 2.3.0 or so, at least once all platforms have been updated. Else bugs in the old formatter can be committed to our repo.
Wed, Oct 16, 2024, 02:14:47 - Sergey: Is there some autopep8 configuration which might have different default value or something?

Wed, Oct 16, 2024, 02:17:02 - Sergey: Thing i am not sure is: should we try to get to the bottom of why initial testing didn't show difference in format?
Wed, Oct 16, 2024, 02:17:58 - Cl√©ment Foucault: ideasman42:

> depth ordered all items occluded, where any fully occluded pixels are omitted.

I am not sure I get this part. Does it mean: select all object by their visible pixels and then order them by dpeth?

Also w√∏uld be nice to know how to test each mode.

From what I understand, there is conceptually only 2 selection mode, one for selecting everything and one for selecting only frontmost surfaces with occlusion. Am I right?
Wed, Oct 16, 2024, 02:18:06 - Bastien Montagne: ideasman42: most changes are like that:

Wed, Oct 16, 2024, 02:18:28 - ideasman42: What file is this for? Because autopep8 1.6x also does this - in my tests.

Wed, Oct 16, 2024, 02:19:54 - ideasman42: `make format` was ignoring `scripts/addons_core` IIRC, perhaps that changed. Although am speaking off hand, would have to double check this...
Previously I would open addons_core scripts and they would re-format on save, which I always found annoying.

Wed, Oct 16, 2024, 02:29:42 - Sergey: i think it's a substring check or something, and thats why `./` was failign when given an absolute path. so maybe should be `/extern` etc ?

Wed, Oct 16, 2024, 05:23:25 - Bart van der Braak: Some routers or ISPs block specific ports for security reasons. Check if port 22 is being blocked either by your router or ISP.

Some routers have built-in firewalls that can block outbound or inbound connections to specific ports. If your router‚Äôs firewall is configured too restrictively, it might be blocking outgoing SSH traffic.

If UPnP is enabled on your router, it might be automatically redirecting or filtering traffic in a way that affects your ability to use SSH.

Is anyone at BF thinking about opening Blender up more to be modifiable by 3rd party extensions or do you prefer to keep it closed? What are the BF developers' feelings in this area? What do you see happening here in the future?
Thu, Oct 17, 2024, 01:07:49 - Thomas Dinges: See our FAQ https://developer.blender.org/docs/handbook/new_developers/faq/#can-a-c-plugin-api-be-added
Thu, Oct 17, 2024, 01:09:27 - Memm: I've seen that, but what I"m asking is whether anybody currently cares about making it more modular? Regardless of difficulty etc... is anyone actively looking into this area?
Thu, Oct 17, 2024, 01:09:59 - Thomas Dinges: Not that I am aware
Thu, Oct 17, 2024, 01:11:01 - Memm: Have you heard Ton talk about it at all? I'm wondering whether you think making blender more modular / open for 3rd party development is something you think is important for Blender's future?
Thu, Oct 17, 2024, 01:12:02 - Memm: Just trying to gouge the feelings around this area, not the technical side per se but if you think this area is important for Blender in general or not.
Thu, Oct 17, 2024, 01:12:52 - Thomas Dinges: There is not only the technical side, the questions is also whether there are actual benefits. Imagine a Blender ecosystem, where people have to buy 10 plugins in order to really use it. If there would be a C++ API, it's likely people would rather develop a commercial plugin rather than improving the feature in Blender itself freely available for anyone
Thu, Oct 17, 2024, 01:14:52 - Memm: That's one side of this, yes. But on the other hand imagine having 1000 more developers, especially for experimental / research features that nobody at BF would touch internally and would never happen otherwise.
Thu, Oct 17, 2024, 01:16:31 - Memm: It also means less code reviewing and more experimentation, because addon developers are responsible for their addons working, not you.
Thu, Oct 17, 2024, 01:20:26 - Memm: You might also have a pipeline where addons get integrated into blender after first being tested outside of it.
Thu, Oct 17, 2024, 01:30:52 - Falk David: Personally, I'm fine with Blender not being attractive to C++ addon developers. To me, that's a feature rather than a bug.
Thu, Oct 17, 2024, 01:31:47 - Falk David: I think a future where Blender is attractive to developers who want to contribute to Blender itself is a better future.
Thu, Oct 17, 2024, 01:34:25 - Memm: The way I see it is addons are the gateway to that.
Thu, Oct 17, 2024, 01:35:07 - Memm: How else will you make Blender attractive to developers?
Thu, Oct 17, 2024, 01:36:38 - Falk David: By improving the code quality, making it more readable, hackable, better code documentation on developer.blender.org/docs etc etc.
Thu, Oct 17, 2024, 01:37:20 - Falk David: From my experience, it's moving in that direction. I've seen more people jump on board than ever
Thu, Oct 17, 2024, 01:40:13 - Memm: Jump on board to do what?
Thu, Oct 17, 2024, 01:41:15 - Falk David: To contribute to the project. Writing PRs, proposing ideas, etc.
Thu, Oct 17, 2024, 01:41:39 - Memm: For example I've noticed lately a lot of addons experimenting with SDF. Has anyone proposed implementing that in the core?
Thu, Oct 17, 2024, 01:43:26 - Falk David: There have been some proposals yea. Maybe not the type of SDF that you're thinking about. See e.g. https://devtalk.blender.org/t/sdf-functions/11055
Thu, Oct 17, 2024, 01:43:47 - Memm: There are already at least 4 or 5 addons working in that area. And there are already multiple applications outside of Blender that have implemented it. My question is why are they doing it as addons, or putting into Autodesk apps, instead of contributing this into Blender?
Thu, Oct 17, 2024, 01:44:14 - Falk David: You'd have to ask them!
Thu, Oct 17, 2024, 01:45:59 - Memm: Maybe there are reason I don't understand but I think it comes down to just two: A) big features need funding and B) it's easier
Thu, Oct 17, 2024, 01:49:15 - Falk David: For A) I think a lot of people are still stuck in the mindset of "why would I spend money on making something that will be open-sourced?". And yea I agree with B) but I don't think the solution is for the Blender project to spend  time and resources on a C++ API that would make it easier for others to spend _less_ time and resources on Blender to then publish a commercial addon that makes them money, but doesn't help the goal of the Blender project.
Thu, Oct 17, 2024, 01:52:36 - Memm: Well the SDF thread you linked the last post was from almost 2 years ago and it looks like it never made it past code review, even though everyone liked it.
Thu, Oct 17, 2024, 01:53:36 - Memm: Compare that to simply making an addon, putting it online and if it works, users are happy. Bypassing any other red tape.
Thu, Oct 17, 2024, 01:55:55 - Falk David: From what I can tell, code review never began because the patch wasn't finished.
Thu, Oct 17, 2024, 01:56:33 - Falk David: Last commit on the branch was still WIP development
Thu, Oct 17, 2024, 01:57:01 - Memm: It might be more productive to find a way to bring commercial addons into the core of Blender, rather than just not having them at all.
Thu, Oct 17, 2024, 01:57:36 - Falk David: See my point above.
Thu, Oct 17, 2024, 01:57:51 - Falk David: > I don't think the solution is for the Blender project to spend time and resources on a C++ API that would make it easier for others to spend less time and resources on Blender to then publish a commercial addon that makes them money, but doesn't help the goal of the Blender project.
Thu, Oct 17, 2024, 02:01:29 - Memm: Yeah but like I said I don't think it will stop people from contributing to Blender, just like the Python API doesn't stop it now. It would instead incentivise outside development that you could then potentially bring inside.
Thu, Oct 17, 2024, 02:02:59 - Falk David: That's too big of an *potentially* for it to justify working on a multi-year project imho. It's much more productive to improve the things I've mentioned to bring in contributors.
Thu, Oct 17, 2024, 02:06:06 - Memm: Well it's a risk, sure, but there's also a risk of Blender falling behind while all the interesting graphics research is taken up by other software, or addons half-hacked into Blender through the current API.
Thu, Oct 17, 2024, 02:08:40 - Falk David: Well I think the opposite is true. If you look at the numbers, Blender tends to be more popular than ever.
But even if Blender were to "fall behind", that's ok. There's no "risk". Blender is not a commercial product that needs the stock to go up to survive.
Thu, Oct 17, 2024, 02:17:34 - Memm: What does Blender need to continue living in your opinion?
Thu, Oct 17, 2024, 02:18:39 - Memm: It's more popular than ever, but there's also more 3D software than ever.

Thu, Oct 17, 2024, 02:22:42 - Falk David: Depends on how you define "living". Even if all work on Blender stopped today, it'll still be there for people to download.
I think there will always be young developers excited about 3D, downloading blenders source and start hacking on it. So as long as that keeps happening, I'm not worried about the Blender project dying out.
Thu, Oct 17, 2024, 02:23:31 - 3di: Blender UI is unusuable for anything except scrolling the properties panel with the scrollbar (can't scroll properties with middle mouse, registers a few jerky movements then ignores continued mouse movement).
Thu, Oct 17, 2024, 02:26:19 - Memm: Fair enough. Well I'm just opening the topic up for conversation, would be interesting to see what others think about how "open" Blender should be to development.
Thu, Oct 17, 2024, 02:28:36 - Falk David: Yes I think that's a conversation that we should regularly have. If others think that it's too hard to contribute to Blender, then we need to look at whatever we can do to improve it. 
Thu, Oct 17, 2024, 02:29:14 - Sebastian Parborg: Blender not having a C++ API is actually enforcing more openness.
It is a bit like the MIT vs GPL discussions.
One gives the freedom to the end user and the other to the masses.

Ton has been quite clear that our goal is to provide freedom to the masses. Not the individual user.
Thu, Oct 17, 2024, 02:29:34 - Falk David: (And also figure out what the real reasons are the people don't contribute)
Thu, Oct 17, 2024, 02:37:16 - Memm: <@zeddb:blender.org "Blender not having a C++ API is ..."> That's a really interesting take! I'll have to think about that.
Thu, Oct 17, 2024, 02:58:13 - Memm: Sebastian Parborg: do think it's possible to have both? Freedom to the users and masses.
Thu, Oct 17, 2024, 03:01:12 - Sebastian Parborg: No, because the freedom of the individual includes taking away freedom from the masses.
Thu, Oct 17, 2024, 03:19:33 - Memm: Hmm, but the C++ API would still be GPL, shouldn't be much different from the Python API. As long as you're developing around Blender your software will also be GPL. So at any point, even for a commercial addon, you can take the code and put it inside Blender if you really want to.
Thu, Oct 17, 2024, 03:20:59 - Memm: At least legally, ethically is a different question.
Thu, Oct 17, 2024, 03:34:36 - Memm: Might sound weird but what if you had a kind of agreement that commercial projects using the C++ API would after some number of years become part of Blender's core.

Thu, Oct 17, 2024, 04:11:23 - zouali1: is there a meeting today i have an assignment to participate in a meeting
Thu, Oct 17, 2024, 04:22:28 - Falk David: Leaving all the challenges and issues with such an agreement aside, why would someone agree to do this if they can contribute to Blender directly?
Thu, Oct 17, 2024, 04:36:53 - Memm: Contribute what? Small bug fixes and such can be done for free, but larger projects that takes a year or more can't be done without funding or some commercial incentive.
Thu, Oct 17, 2024, 04:37:38 - Memm: Blender is open source but it's not "free" to develop. Everyone working at BF gets paid, and Blender has funding and grants.
Thu, Oct 17, 2024, 04:41:30 - Memm: Developers need strong motivation to contribute. Otherwise projects die half way through when the poor students find a job or just give up. :)
Thu, Oct 17, 2024, 04:44:10 - Jeroen Bakker: Might be that it uses a software renderer and not your GPU. I can imagine that this is a limitation of RDP protocol as the server (Windows) doesn't have access to the GPU on your client (Ubuntu)
Thu, Oct 17, 2024, 04:51:22 - Sebastian Parborg: There is nothing preventing people from doing their own fundraisers and or getting outside funding to get features into Blender.

Introducing more external APIs will not change this.
Thu, Oct 17, 2024, 04:59:59 - Falk David: > Contribute what?

I was responding to what you said:

> commercial projects using the C++ API would after some number of years become part of Blender's core

My question then was, if someone agreed that their code would be contributed to Blender after some time, why not contribute directly?

My point is basically that anyone who wants to write something using the C++ API could just as well write the change directly into Blenders internal C++ API. And the ones who wouldn't want to contribute to Blender directly also wouldn't agree to what you propose.
Thu, Oct 17, 2024, 05:03:10 - Falk David: <@memm:blender.org "Developers need strong motivatio..."> Yes. I'd argue that this is ok. We need people that are motivated to do something, without ouside incentive. The issue becomes when those people can't contribute because of some failiure in the process.
Thu, Oct 17, 2024, 05:08:03 - Falk David: Of course there are also contributors that are hired by companies, e.g. NVIDIA, Apple, etc. and hopefully more companies and studios start to do this in the future.

Thu, Oct 17, 2024, 12:59:30 - 3di: finally got it sorted.  Putting solution here incase it's handy for anyone else wanting to control blender on ubuntu via rdp from windows 11.

Needed to join an already open session on ubuntu using desktop sharing and remote control, rather than remotely logging in.   Which meant setting user to auto log in when the machine boots up.  Then to get smooth movement in the 3d viewport needed to disable continuous grab.

This is using the built in rdp in the latest Ubuntu, which required that xrdp was not installed (otherwise you get a second authentication screen which doesn't allow you through even with the correct credentials.).

Thu, Oct 17, 2024, 22:00:15 - Memm: Hi, a small question:
From what I understand rna_mesh.cc are using the data definitions from DNA_meshdata_types.h, for example rna_def_mvert() is linked to the struct MVert. But that struct is deprecated, in the code it says:
"Deprecated mesh vertex data structure. Now stored with generic attributes."

So on the python side something like data.vertices[0] are still linked to the above data structure, but because it's deprecated will this be changed in the future? I'm trying to understand if the deprecation will impact how data can accessed, or if this is safe to use.
Thu, Oct 17, 2024, 22:18:23 - Jesse Y: You can use the common `attributes` accessor nowadays for general access to anything that's been attached to the geometry:
```python
# Move the "Cube" object up 1 unit on the Z axis
for v in bpy.data.objects["Cube"].data.attributes["position"].data:
    v.vector.z += 1.0
```
Thu, Oct 17, 2024, 22:30:12 - Memm: I see, but the mesh data doesn't seem to be part of that yet.
Thu, Oct 17, 2024, 22:35:17 - Jesse Y: Which data are you looking for?
Thu, Oct 17, 2024, 22:57:08 - Memm: Verts, edges, faces and UVs.
Thu, Oct 17, 2024, 22:57:37 - Memm: Like the kind of data you get from exporting a mesh. Normals and so on.
Thu, Oct 17, 2024, 23:00:36 - Memm: But python is too slow for this. So I'm looking into as_pointer() usage.
Thu, Oct 17, 2024, 23:03:33 - Memm: And because the current way of getting this data with as_pointer is deprecated on the C side, I'm wondering how long it'll remain available.
Thu, Oct 17, 2024, 23:12:57 - Jesse Y: That should all be present in some form, though normals are more complicated. I have to run since it's late here but a standard cube for example has edge/face indices as well as UV map attributes accordingly:
```
<bpy_struct, FloatVectorAttribute("position") at 0x0000023EE07A6A00>
<bpy_struct, BoolAttribute(".select_vert") at 0x0000023EE07A6A78>
<bpy_struct, Int2Attribute(".edge_verts") at 0x0000023EE07A4E08> # indices that define the edges
<bpy_struct, BoolAttribute(".select_edge") at 0x0000023EE07A4E80>
<bpy_struct, BoolAttribute(".select_poly") at 0x0000023EE07A4B88>
<bpy_struct, BoolAttribute("sharp_face") at 0x0000023EE07A4C00>
<bpy_struct, IntAttribute(".corner_vert") at 0x0000023EE07A4688>  # indices that define the faces
<bpy_struct, IntAttribute(".corner_edge") at 0x0000023EE07A4700>
<bpy_struct, Float2Attribute("UVMap") at 0x0000023EE07A4778>   # UV map data (could be more than one if added etc.)
```

Someone else may be able to help further. Unsure of timelines for complete removal of old api.
Fri, Oct 18, 2024, 00:08:31 - Thomas Dinges: Good morning, does anyone know why we have `{fmt}` lib twice? It's in `extern\fmtlib` and also in `versions.cmake`
Fri, Oct 18, 2024, 00:21:43 - Aras Pranckeviƒçius: My understanding is that some libraries that we build (OpenImageIO perhaps) need fmt to build themselves. So versions.cmake would be for the "I need to rebuild OIIO or something" case. The one embedded into extern is for when blender code uses fmt directly case.
Fri, Oct 18, 2024, 00:23:50 - Thomas Dinges: Thanks, question then is if we could/want to deduplicate this? Maybe a question for Sergey 
Fri, Oct 18, 2024, 00:24:38 - Thomas Dinges: But can also mark the one in cmake as Dependency time build only, this way it does not show up in the new license document
Fri, Oct 18, 2024, 01:41:44 - Sergey: Bart van der Braak: Did you break my ship? The https://projects.blender.org/ doesn't open here
Fri, Oct 18, 2024, 01:42:00 - Bart van der Braak: Something DNS related
Fri, Oct 18, 2024, 01:42:09 - Bart van der Braak: I am investigating
Fri, Oct 18, 2024, 01:47:55 - Bart van der Braak: Sergey:

Our internal DNS resolver is borked.
If I ask Google or Cloudflare directly, it resolves fine:

```
bart@ws-bart ~ $ dig +short @1.1.1.1 projects.blender.org
82.94.226.107
bart@ws-bart ~ $ dig +short @8.8.8.8 projects.blender.org
82.94.226.107
```
Fri, Oct 18, 2024, 01:48:38 - Falk David: Having the same issue. Can't reach p.b.o
Fri, Oct 18, 2024, 01:49:06 - Bastien Montagne: Falk David: switch your wired network settings to use 8.8.8.8 DNS for now?
Fri, Oct 18, 2024, 01:51:38 - Falk David: leaked IP üò±
Fri, Oct 18, 2024, 01:51:41 - Falk David: :P
Fri, Oct 18, 2024, 01:52:16 - Wu Yiming: seems fine here for me

Fri, Oct 18, 2024, 01:52:43 - Falk David: yea it's only our internal DNS here at the office it seems
Fri, Oct 18, 2024, 02:02:21 - Bart van der Braak: Should be resolved ‚úÖÔ∏è
Fri, Oct 18, 2024, 02:09:28 - troubled: Restarted dns resolver seemed to fix it *shrug*
Fri, Oct 18, 2024, 02:12:45 - Thomas Dinges: Speaking of licenses, we ship LZMA twice, one in extern (the original one) and another variant of it (fork) in cmake.

Fri, Oct 18, 2024, 03:26:01 - Dalai Felinto: What is going on with all these SPIRV_HEADERS libraries? We have three of them?
Fri, Oct 18, 2024, 03:32:34 - Falk David: Looks like there are conficts when merging main with the release branch
Fri, Oct 18, 2024, 03:32:39 - Falk David: Seems to be caused by https://projects.blender.org/blender/blender/pulls/129028
Fri, Oct 18, 2024, 03:33:16 - Falk David: Don't wanna mess with the conflicts there... could anyone take a look?
Fri, Oct 18, 2024, 03:34:52 - Falk David: Sergey iss 
Fri, Oct 18, 2024, 03:35:29 - iss: Sure, will do  
Fri, Oct 18, 2024, 03:47:40 - Falk David: Looks like Jacques Lucke resolved the conflict now?
Fri, Oct 18, 2024, 03:48:30 - iss: Still pulling 4.3 libs...
Fri, Oct 18, 2024, 03:49:10 - Jacques Lucke: Oh, didn't notice a conflict when I merged, git didn't mention any merge conflict
Fri, Oct 18, 2024, 03:50:02 - Falk David: hm strange.. maybe my git is setup to not try and resolve conflicts it can resolve üòÖ
Fri, Oct 18, 2024, 03:50:54 - Falk David: Do you have some default merge strategy setup?
Fri, Oct 18, 2024, 03:52:08 - Falk David: Seems like main is not in a wrong state, so I guess it worked out
Fri, Oct 18, 2024, 03:52:27 - iss: But should poke John Kiril Swenson - Please do merge to main when you push to 4.3 next time. See [docs](https://developer.blender.org/docs/handbook/release_process/release_branch/#committing-to-the-stabilizing-branch)
If there are conflicts or you are not sure with the process, poke me or some good samaritan here, so we can assist
Fri, Oct 18, 2024, 04:59:20 - Memm: For normals it looks like you can do
D.objects['Cube'].data.polygon_normals[0].as_pointer()
Fri, Oct 18, 2024, 04:59:50 - Memm: Which isn't deprecated.

Fri, Oct 18, 2024, 07:22:27 - @globalkrampus:blender.org left the room
Fri, Oct 18, 2024, 08:04:47 - John Kiril Swenson: image.png (Media omitted)
Fri, Oct 18, 2024, 08:04:59 - John Kiril Swenson: I should've merged it last night... what ended up being the issue?
Fri, Oct 18, 2024, 08:08:59 - John Kiril Swenson: Falk David any ideas what went wrong? Maybe I screwed something up since I haven't done this often but just want to know for the future so I can prevent it from happening again :)
Fri, Oct 18, 2024, 08:24:58 - Thomas Dinges: 4.2, 4.3 and main have a new way of dealing with licenses/copyright information for third party libraries. This is especially important for platform maintainers and developers who add a new library. Sebastian Parborg Jonas Holzman LazyDodo 

- All libraries have a license and copyright info now (`extern\*\README.blender` and in `versions.cmake`).
- If you update a library version, run `make license` and commit the updated `license.md`
- If you add a new library, please make sure you also add a homepage, license and copyright info.
Fri, Oct 18, 2024, 08:27:09 - Thomas Dinges: I will update the docs at https://developer.blender.org/docs/handbook/release_process/release_checklist/third_party_licenses/ but that's for Monday
Fri, Oct 18, 2024, 08:32:55 - LazyDodo: Thomas Dinges: i'm not responsible for compliance, I'll allow your stuff in my builder for convenience, but you get to maintain it
Fri, Oct 18, 2024, 08:33:53 - Thomas Dinges: You are not. But the person who updates the readme files or versions cmake should run one command, thing gets generated and voila
Fri, Oct 18, 2024, 08:34:28 - LazyDodo: you're trying to offload a job you don't like on an unpaid volunteer
Fri, Oct 18, 2024, 08:34:38 - LazyDodo: gonna put my foot down here, not happening
Fri, Oct 18, 2024, 08:35:07 - Thomas Dinges: You misunderstand me clearly
Fri, Oct 18, 2024, 08:35:43 - LazyDodo: you're trying to obfuscate it by phrasing it as "the person who updates versions.cmake" that's me.. 90% of the edits are me
Fri, Oct 18, 2024, 08:35:49 - Thomas Dinges: For updated libs (the person who bumps a version in for example `versions.cmake` should run one command `make license`. That's not different than running `make format`
Fri, Oct 18, 2024, 08:36:06 - Thomas Dinges: I don't expect you to do a legal check
Fri, Oct 18, 2024, 08:36:44 - LazyDodo: you are literally asking that though, "If you add a new library, please make sure you also add a homepage, license and copyright info."
Fri, Oct 18, 2024, 08:37:24 - Thomas Dinges: Then I will add the three lines, no worries
Fri, Oct 18, 2024, 08:37:25 - Thomas Dinges: Now relax
Fri, Oct 18, 2024, 08:37:29 - Thomas Dinges: Message deleted
Fri, Oct 18, 2024, 08:38:26 - LazyDodo: Just so you know, i know your situation, not upset with your personally, on the other hand i can very much not let this fly
Fri, Oct 18, 2024, 08:38:29 - LazyDodo: take it to your leaders 
Fri, Oct 18, 2024, 08:41:27 - Thomas Dinges: You are not adding new libs, isn't this done by devs? I would ask the devs to provide the info. If they don't , no new lib for them
Fri, Oct 18, 2024, 08:41:58 - LazyDodo: platform module scripts most of the deps, we're better at it and faster
Fri, Oct 18, 2024, 08:42:18 - LazyDodo: once in a while intel or amd will submit ready work there, but it's the exception
Fri, Oct 18, 2024, 08:42:35 - LazyDodo: you can't ask harley to go figure out how the deps builder works
Fri, Oct 18, 2024, 08:42:58 - LazyDodo: and especially not for platforms he doesn't have
Fri, Oct 18, 2024, 08:44:31 - Thomas Dinges: LazyDodo: I am sorry, my brain is toast. You already get infos from devs requesting a new library. The name of the lib, the version etc
Fri, Oct 18, 2024, 08:45:02 - Thomas Dinges: From now on you will get a URL, license and copyright info as well. You are not expected to figure things out or do a research
Fri, Oct 18, 2024, 08:45:06 - LazyDodo: we should formalize the adding of new libraries, it happens more often and it's pretty much the wild west
Fri, Oct 18, 2024, 08:45:25 - Thomas Dinges: All for it
Fri, Oct 18, 2024, 08:45:42 - LazyDodo: there's no clear rules and what will and won't be allowed and where it will live (git-lfs /exten, /intern)
Fri, Oct 18, 2024, 08:46:16 - LazyDodo: if we were to form some procedure there, incorporating license requirements would be totally possible
Fri, Oct 18, 2024, 08:46:17 - Thomas Dinges: The biggest mess is duplication. We have two versions of FMT, 3 of SPIRV-HEADERs and various LLVMS
Fri, Oct 18, 2024, 08:46:39 - Thomas Dinges: also 2x LZMA
Fri, Oct 18, 2024, 08:47:09 - LazyDodo: won't be de-duplicated though, it's sadly just a fact of life, if intel did their conformance testing on version X, we use X since we don't want to bring any more risk into the system
Fri, Oct 18, 2024, 08:47:23 - LazyDodo: if then AMD uses Y for their llvm fork, same story there
Fri, Oct 18, 2024, 08:47:52 - LazyDodo: i'd like it for everyone to work in mainline LLVM, but that's not how anyone rolls these days
Fri, Oct 18, 2024, 08:49:54 - LazyDodo: how about, i'll come up with some framework in the next couple of weeks/months (unsure, time is scarse) and we run it by you and the admins for approval?
Fri, Oct 18, 2024, 08:51:22 - Thomas Dinges: Sure. As said, I will update the docs and can also add what is expected from people who request a new library
Fri, Oct 18, 2024, 09:03:39 - Thomas Dinges: For people who are curious, we went from [this labyrinth of text](https://projects.blender.org/blender/blender/src/commit/65762c880fcbff57a273bf0fb18a6150d2eef652/release/license/THIRD-PARTY-LICENSES.txt) to this nice [markdown file](https://projects.blender.org/blender/blender/src/branch/main/release/license/license.md)
Fri, Oct 18, 2024, 09:13:28 - Falk David: Sergey Why is the windows bot failing? https://builder.blender.org/admin/#/builders/133/builds/7744
Fri, Oct 18, 2024, 09:14:08 - Bastien Montagne: Falk David: my bet would be that its one of the new workers that Bart van der Braak added?
Fri, Oct 18, 2024, 09:14:29 - Falk David: ```

Fri, Oct 18, 2024, 09:15:39 - LazyDodo: Thomas Dinges is more likely
Fri, Oct 18, 2024, 09:16:09 - Thomas Dinges: Eeeek
Fri, Oct 18, 2024, 09:16:26 - Bart van der Braak: Let me take a peek, am in the bus
Fri, Oct 18, 2024, 09:16:46 - Bart van der Braak: If a new worker keeps failing without resolution I‚Äôll pause it for the time being.
Fri, Oct 18, 2024, 09:17:31 - Thomas Dinges: A `GPL-3.0.txt` is indeed not in there
Fri, Oct 18, 2024, 09:17:54 - Dalai Felinto: Thomas Dinges: packaging.cmake needs fix
Fri, Oct 18, 2024, 09:18:10 - Dalai Felinto: this was that last [ ] on the PR :) the one about making sure things are copied where they are expected
Fri, Oct 18, 2024, 09:18:22 - Dalai Felinto: I tried with make release and it worked
Fri, Oct 18, 2024, 09:18:28 - Dalai Felinto: I guess I didnt try with make package
Fri, Oct 18, 2024, 09:18:31 - Bart van der Braak: Not worker-related then? Dalai Felinto 
Fri, Oct 18, 2024, 09:18:44 - Dalai Felinto: Bart van der Braak: no, it is code-related, we know how/where to fix it
Fri, Oct 18, 2024, 09:18:44 - LazyDodo: i had it but then i pulled ` rename release/license/{GPL-3.0.txt => spdx/GPL-3.0-or-later.txt} (100%)`

Fri, Oct 18, 2024, 12:57:38 - mushroomeo: guys i wanted talk about one super annoying little thing, in blender if you rotate object then you have to rotate aropund the object, its was good before we had the feature to press B and lock on some vertec to use it as direction that was recently added that super feature, but now its no more needed, and so we need a option to disable it and only allow rotating idf you move the mouse to left or right,because its very annoying frustrating that always see in what direction you move the mouse...
Fri, Oct 18, 2024, 12:58:20 - mushroomeo: i mean if you press the R button 2 times for rotating around it makes sense but if pressing 1 time R it doesnt make sense anymore
Fri, Oct 18, 2024, 12:58:44 - mushroomeo: and so so many times tye users need to zoom out to rotate normaly...
Fri, Oct 18, 2024, 12:59:49 - Hans Goudey: weizhen Pushed a fix, sorry about that!
Fri, Oct 18, 2024, 13:01:25 - mushroomeo: i mean the other softwares dont need to spin the muse cursor aorund objects like crazy only to change direction of object or not?
Fri, Oct 18, 2024, 13:02:28 - Hans Goudey: Hi mushroomeo, this chat is for development, feedback should go elsewhere, like rightclickselect.com

Fri, Oct 18, 2024, 15:00:20 - sensarice: Our company has developed numerous tools using dirent to facilitate the exchange of formats between different software. These tools convert scenes into folders and perform batch imports, which have then been integrated as plugins for various software applications. This has led me to consider that the "string" node section in Blender's Geometry Nodes might benefit from features such as "search folder," "split by line," and "count lines." I will be attempting to create these nodes next. Perhaps we can enable Blender users to create their own folder parsers and batch I/O tools using Geometry Nodes.
Fri, Oct 18, 2024, 15:21:08 - Iliya Katushenock: Sould just like sql...
Fri, Oct 18, 2024, 18:58:58 - sensarice: If each added node needs an enumeration, then does the order in which they are arranged matter?
Fri, Oct 18, 2024, 19:30:49 - sensarice: node_geo_string_join and   node_fn_string_length?  why the forder !=?
Sat, Oct 19, 2024, 01:43:32 - epai: Hello everyone, I have a question.In eevee, there is a geometry shader eevee_legacy_lightprobe_vert,the input is lightprobe_vert.glsl,and the output is  eevee_legacy_lightprobe_vert_geom_iface. There is a line of code in lightprobe_vert.glsl:vert_iface.face = gl_InstanceID;I don‚Äôt understand the function of this geometry shader, and why the built-in variable gl_InstanceID is called here.

Sat, Oct 19, 2024, 06:45:29 - sensarice: Iliya Katushenock: I currently believe that storing string properties is a rather imprudent practice, as it doesn‚Äôt prevent someone from storing an entire document on a vertex. Therefore, I think adding '*' and '&' nodes to Geometry Nodes might be more practical.
Sat, Oct 19, 2024, 15:20:09 - sensarice: Storing an enum and an array at a vertex doesn't seem too difficult, what puzzles me is how to make the pointers point to the correct addresses when the file is reopened.

If the code is not submitted now, it could lead to the addition of countless new nodes later, which would make code review difficult.

Sun, Oct 20, 2024, 07:17:39 - Vyach: Hello developers. Is there a manual/list how to replace ffmpeg libraries in blender? I want to use version with nvenc compatibility, because it appears, that blender is pretty handy with video-editing. But have slow encoder.
Sun, Oct 20, 2024, 07:21:11 - Vyach sent an image. (Media omitted)
Sun, Oct 20, 2024, 07:21:13 - Vyach: The issue is libraries have different (not default) names
Sun, Oct 20, 2024, 07:26:08 - LazyDodo: what's not default about them?
Sun, Oct 20, 2024, 07:26:29 - LazyDodo: they come like this straight out of our ffmpeg build, we don't do any renames or anything
Sun, Oct 20, 2024, 07:28:58 - LazyDodo: also just dropping in new dll's won't make it faster, will require some changes on the blender side of things to make it actually use the faster encoders
Sun, Oct 20, 2024, 07:29:13 - Aras Pranckeviƒçius: Vyach: even if you replaced ffmpeg libraries used by blender, you'd still "somehow" would need for blender to tell ffmpeg to use nvenc encoder. Looking into hardware video encoding/decoding (via ffmpeg nvenc or other means) is "in the plans", but not sure when exactly we'll do it.
Sun, Oct 20, 2024, 07:55:26 - sensarice: Our company is promoting a 3D modeling software primarily using the OSG file format, which is mainly used for processing terrain data scanned by drones. It can be applied in areas such as mine exploration and game scene creation. I would like to ask if there are any Blender developers who would be willing to create import/export functions for OSG files in Blender.
Sun, Oct 20, 2024, 07:56:12 - sensarice: https://openscenegraph.github.io/openscenegraph.io/
Sun, Oct 20, 2024, 09:40:48 - Vyach: So it sounds like ¬´the only proper way ‚Äî¬†is to make separate Blender build¬ª, right?
But I hope nvenc option will appear someday. Amateur video editing is really nice and fast with Blender (idk about professional). I shifted from Shotcut. It was nice too, but with 30min+ stripes and multiple cuts it stutters a lot.

Thanks for reply.
Sun, Oct 20, 2024, 09:43:17 - LazyDodo: it's not just rebuilding with the right flags, the code for blender to use nvenc or any other gpu based enoder is missing someone has to sit down and write it
Sun, Oct 20, 2024, 11:38:11 - Aras Pranckeviƒçius: Vyach meanwhile, even if it is not nvenc, you can try updating to more recent blender versions. All of these: 4.1, 4.2, 4.3 (beta), 4.4 (alpha) had video related performance improvements compared to previous versions. Not hardware acceleration, but still speedups.

Mon, Oct 21, 2024, 01:24:42 - Dalai Felinto: I have the broken .zips locally in case the re-build replaces them and someone wants to do some forensics
Mon, Oct 21, 2024, 01:29:42 - Dalai Felinto: I haven't done a valgrind build in a long, long while. Is it just a matter of enabling "WITH_MEM_VALGRIND" on ccmake? or do I also need to turn off ASAN?

 I did a build here (Linux) to investigate a crash, but it is rendering way too fast for a valgrind debug build, so I suspect maybe it is missing something.
Mon, Oct 21, 2024, 01:46:15 - Dalai Felinto: deheck ... rebuild has no errors, yet the .zips are still bogus

I am having one little trouble while trying to build Blender on Release mode. Should I share the questions here or should I use another channel? Couldn't find any channels related to troubleshooting. Thanks.
